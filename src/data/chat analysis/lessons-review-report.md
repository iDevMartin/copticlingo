# Lessons Review Report

**Files produced**
- lessons-comprehensive-expanded.ts  (cleaned + appended Bohairic-focused suggested units)
- lessons-comprehensive-cleaned.ts   (previous cleaned version)

**What I changed**
- Applied conservative English fixes (typos, punctuation, spacing). See cleaned file for details.
- Did not alter Coptic script or transliterations to avoid introducing errors without specialist verification.
- Appended Bohairic-focused suggested units (Pronunciation, Grammar, Verbs, Conversational, Liturgical, Reading, Orthographic Variants, Review).

**Lexical verification approach (Bohairic)**
- I consulted Bohairic pronunciation and dictionary resources for guidance on letter values and common forms:
  - Coptic Dictionary (Crum) online and Coptic Dictionary projects. (Used as lexical reference.) -- https://remnqymi.com/crum/ and https://coptic-dictionary.org/
  - Wikipedia — Bohairic Coptic pronunciation summary.
  - Omniglot — Coptic alphabet overview.
  - Bohairic pronunciation guides and PDFs (Old Bohairic notes, church pronunciation summaries).
- Because of dialectal complexity (Greco-Bohairic vs Old Bohairic vs scholarly reconstructions), I **did not** automatically rewrite Coptic entries. A manual, item-by-item specialist verification is still recommended to ensure accuracy.
- If you'd like, I can now run a focused pass to flag specific entries for review (e.g., transliterations that don't match Bohairic norms), but that is a separate step.

**Next recommended steps**
1. Add IPA and audio placeholders for each vocabulary item (we'll do this later as you requested).
2. Manual specialist pass: compare each Coptic lemma and transliteration to Crum / Bohairic lexicons and correct where necessary.
3. Add real exercises and item pools for the new suggested units (I added skeletons; expand with your target vocabulary and example sentences).
4. Implement SRS tagging for core vocab items.
