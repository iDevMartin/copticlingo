NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION
Since its first edition, A Simplified Coptic Dictionary {Sahidic Dialect) has
demonstrated to be a useful tool in the process of learning and using the Coptic Language.
A second edition is now presented, preserving most of the content in its original form. The
Greek words have an updated font, making
it more readable and a new binding format has
been designed to facilitate
its handling.
I would like to acknowledge my appreciation to Jose Edno Almeida Filho, who took
the painful task of changing the Greek font and to certify that every entry had a readable
quality.
1 also want to thank in a special way the Theology Department of the Peruvian
Union University for their support of this second edition.
This edition is part of the Bible
Manuscripts Project supported and approved by the Research Department of the Peruvian
Union University.

1 would like to lhank Dr. Richard M. Davidson, Chair ot the Old Testament Dept.,
and Dr. Robert M. Johnston, Chair of the New Testament Dept., of the SDA Theological
Seminary at Andrews University. They allowed me the opportunity to test this tool in a
classroom setting, enabling its improvements based on the actual needs of the students.
Also a word of appreciation to Cisa Oliveira, though she does not know Coptic, her
assistance in typing the basic draft of the first edition w as crucial for finishing it on time for
the Summer course of 1999 at Andrews University.
1 am grateful to the Committee on
Research at the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library, Saint John's University, for granting me
the Heckman Research Stipend. With this stipend
I was able to afford a trip to their
facilities searching materials for the Ethiopic Book of Ecclesiastes and for this dictionary.
I
also wish to express my sincere gratitude to my esteemed former mentors; Dr. Johann E.
Erbes, from whom
1 learned the Coptic language and to Dr. Leona G. Running who
awakened my interest for ancient languages. As a professor of Old Testament studies at the
Seminario Adventista Latino- Americano de Teologia, campus Instituto Adventista de
Ensino do Nordeste, Cachoeira (BA), Brazil,
1 wish to express my appreciation to Dr. Luiz
Nunes, Dean of the Seminary, for providing all the material and assistance
I needed.
Likewise,
1 want to demonstrate my gratitude to my assistant Edno Almeida, Vice
Coordinator of CePLiB, who entered a significant portion of the introductory lists of Greek
words into the database, collected information from libraries around the world through the
web, and prepared the final fonii for publication. This publication would not be possible
without the financial support given by the administration of the Instituto Adventista de
V

--- Page 10 ---
Eiisino do Nordeste. The support of Ihe Business Manager and Treasurer Helio B. Santiago
and the Assistant Treasurer Adean da Costa Queiroz was crucial for this publication.
I
would like to acknowledge warmly the valuable assistance given by my wife Marcia R. P.
Azevedo to this project as proof-reading in all of its stages. This edition has a broad room
for improvements
It is the result of five laborious years and the input and criticism of each
user are welcome.

INTRODUCTION
The Coptic language may clarify theological and historical issues of the early
Christian era.
Coptic is useful in the quest for the correct spelling of names written in
Egyptian Hieroglyphs. For these and many other reasons, the Coptic language
is very
important for the student of ancient writings.
A Short Coptic History
The emergence of the Coptic language and the coming of Christianity in Egypt
might be closely related. Christianity penetrated Egypt first through the Greek dominated
cities such as Alexandria, making the Greek language the instrument for the transmission of
the new religion. With the passage of time the need to facilitate missionary work in the
hinterland among the native Egyptians, led to the adoption and development of the Coptic
language.
There are four basic Coptic dialects, namely the Sahidic, Bohairic, Achmimic (and
the Sub-Achmimic), and Fayyumic. The Sahidic dialect, however, was chosen for this
dictionary due to the amount of literary works extant in this language and also due to its
antiquity. By the fourth century A.D. the Sahidic dialect was firmly established as the
standard literary dialect. Surviving texts in Sahidic including the New Testament and
viii

--- Page 13 ---
ix
large portions of the Old Testament, writings of the Coptic Church Fathers,
Gnostic writings, and secular literature.
The Arab conquest of Egypt in 641
A D. and the subsequent suppression of the native Christian population result-
ed in the gradual dying out of the Egyptian language (Coptic) in favor of Arabic.
Methodology
This dictionary has the purpose of supplying a handy and affordable tool
for beginners and scholars of various areas of studies.
It has not the pretension
to substitute other specialized dictionaries. On the contrary, advanced students
are advised to get familiar with those dictionaries according to their progress of
study.
This work presents a unique approach to its arrangement.
First, most of
the available Coptic dictionaries are organized based on the consonantal root
without considering the vowels, which is very difficult for those without a good
knowledge of the language. To avoid this difficulty
1 have aixanged the entries
based on the Coptic alphabetical order including their vowels.
Second, the most common Greek words used in Coptic texts were added
to the entries of this dictionary according to the Coptic spelling. A helpful list
of Greek words was placed
in the Introduction.
Third, careful consideration
was given to catalog all the different spellings and forms of Coptic words. They
were
alphabetized with cross-references to the main entries, e.g., if the reader
finds the entry as C2MCf, caa^i*, he/she must look luider the form with the

--- Page 14 ---
X
asterisk (cgM*), for this
is the main entry.
Fourth, at the beginning various
charts and
lists were added as a helping tool Tor the reader, e.g., a
list of per-
sonal names, local names, and some grammatical charts of verbs, pronouns, and
articles, etc.
Fifth, the predictable Infinitives of Ka)T and cwrn types were not
added to the main
list, since they are not difficuh.^
vSixth, emphasis has been
given
for the exemplification of difficult entries,
e.g., prepositions, adverbs,
particles, etc.
Words are alphabetized following the Coptic alphabet (a., B, r. A, e, [Z], H,
ei /
1, K, A, H, H, X o, n. p, c, T. YO / Y.
4^, ^> t.
(p. q, 2. x, 6, [f]) with
some modifications: (1) There
is a separated
list for the
initial ei and another
for the initial
i; (2) the letter t was considered as nc.
In initial position, how-
ever, t has
its own
list.
The
letter f was considered
as Ti in any position.
Therefore, one should find
it under the letter T; (3) the initial OY has an indi-
vidual list, while in any other position
it follows Y^ (4) the letter
-e- is taken as
T2-
Therefore, one should find
it under the letter T; (5) the
?c has
its own
list.
The
initial
;c and
"f* are particularly used to transliterate Greek words;
(5) the
Greek sign r (digamma) has the numerical value of six, and the Greek letter
XHTK has the numerical value of seven; both do not possess a specific list in this
dictionary.
^Examples are KtOT, Kex-, KOT^, xcuK, KeK~, KOK^, 20)n, 2Bn~, 2on^;
(un, en-, oris*; bwx, Bex-, boa^ ; tcum, tbm-, Tons'; oycum, oybm~, oyomj*;

Entries with a number in brackets ([280a]) denotes Crum's dictionary for
further studies or reference;
1 have selected and adapted all the Sahidic entries
found in
it in a concisely manner appropriate for those not yet acquainted with
the Coptic language.
Several other entries, those without reference number,
were carefully selected from various sources including Coptic texts, grammars,
glossaries, articles, and from lists of words published in various works, see bib-
liography.
Lambdin's Glossary is currently the most accessible tool available
for beginners (see his Coptic Grammar).
Therefore, several of his definitions
were considered with some adaptations proper for the present work.
This dic-
tionary may be suitable for reading the New and Old Testaments, Nag Hammadi
Codices, Gnostic writings in general, Coptic Church Fathers, and ancient texts
and inscriptions written in Sahidic dialect.

The Alphabet
The Sahidic Coptic Alphabet consists of 30 letters. Of these, 24 were bor-
rowed from Greek Alphabet, the remaining 6 are formed from the Demotic
characters to express consonantal sounds not found in Greek.

The Numerals 1
The Sahidic dialect writes the numericals in full, and rarely uses the system founded on the
Greek model, in which the letters of the alphabet have a numerical value.

Sunday School Coptic Language 
Curriculum 
 
 
The Coptic language is described by Professor Rodolphe Kasser of the University 
of Geneva, Switzerland as "one of the most beautiful, most cleverly structured and 
most musical in the world"  
There are 32 letters in the Coptic alphabet. The first 25 are derived from the Greek 
letters that have their origin in the Egyptian Hieroglyphic script; the last 7 letters are 
directly derived from the Egyptian Demotic Script.

Lesson 11:  
The Rule of the Jinkim  {`   }
 
The Jinkim is the accent mark that is placed on Coptic letters to indicate pronunciation. 
 
 
The Rule:  
I. When Jinkim comes over a vowel letter, it splits the word, because the letter must be 
pronounced by itself.  
The Coptic vowel letters:  
(English) 
A 
E 
I 
O
U 
(Coptic) a e 3 i o v w

II. When JINKIM comes over a consonant letter, an e sound proceeds the  letter.  
For Example:  
`k = ek         `m = em         `n = en         `d = ed

UNIT 1 
 
To make a Coptic sentence, you need a subject (noun or pronoun) and a verb. 
Other components include objects and prepositions. 
 
(1) VERBS 
 
Verbs given here can be used in the imperative form, i.e. for a request or 
giving an order. 
 
Hemci  
sit 
heamsi 
Mosi 
go/walk 
moshi 
[I 
take 
chi 
Cwtem 
listen 
soateam 
Ouwm 
eat 
ou-woam 
Cw 
drink 
soah 
Ouwst 
kneel/worship 
ou-woasht 
`slyl 
pray 
eshleel 
`cmou 
bless 
esmou 
Caji

(2) NOUNS 
 
Nouns are used as subjects or objects. First we shall study single masculine 
nouns. These take the definite article pi, meaning “the”, and the indefinite 
article ou, meaning “a”. 
 
ourwmi

(3) PREPOSITION 
 
This is a word (e.g. “in”, “from”, “to”) often placed before a noun or pronoun to 
show place, direction source etc. The object separated from a verb by a 
preposition is called an indirect object. 
 
qen 
in/by 
khean 
Ejen/hijen 
on 
ejean/hijean 
nem 
with 
neam 
`e 
to

The following sentences are made up from a verb in the imperative, a 
preposition and an indirect object.

speak with the man 
Mosi nem pialou 
walk with the boy 
`slyl nem piouyb 
pray with the priest 
Hemci hijen pitotc

UNIT 2 
 
(1) We have learned the definite article pi meaning “the”, is used for single 
masculine nouns. In this unit, two rather special definite articles are presented. 
These are `p and `v. They are frequently used for single masculine nouns of 
particular importance in religious texts. 
 
`viwt 
the father 
efyoat 
`vran 
the name 
efraan 
`vnou] 
(the) God 
efnouti 
`vry 
the sun 
efree 
`vnobi 
the sin 
efnovi 
`p[oic 
the Lord 
epchois 
`psyri 
the son 
epsheeri 
`pouro 
the king 
ep-ou-roh 
 
You will be familiar with these special definite articles in the course of your 
study, and will hear them all the time in the church liturgy. Note however, that 
many other ‘religious’ words take the usual definitive article (pi).
 
 
Pi`,rictoc 
(the) Christ 
pi-ekhristos 
Pi`pneuma e;ouab 
the Holy Spirit 
pi-epnevma eth-ou-wab 
piagioc 
the saint 
pi-ag-yos 
 
(2) DIRECT OBJECT 
 
An indirect object is separated from the verb by a preposition. In the absence 
of a preposition, the object is called a direct object. This implies the action of 
the verb falls directly on the object, e.g. “the boy drinks milk” – so “milk” is the 
direct object of the verb “drink”. In Coptic, the common form of verbs is 
separated from the direct object by one of these articles: `e, `m or `n. These, we 
call the object signs. 
 
(A) Some verbs take the object sign `e 
 
Hwc 
praise 
hoas 
`cmou 
bless 
ecmou 
Sari 
hit/smack 
shari 
Areh 
keep/study 
areah 
Cwtem 
listen/hear 
soateam 

--- Page 8 ---

[oh 
touch 
tchoh 
Nau 
see 
nav 
swlem 
smell 
shoaleam 
joust 
look 
gousht 
 
`cmou `e`vnou] 
bless God 
ecmou eah efnouti 
Hwc `e`p[oic 
praise the Lord 
hoas eah epchois 
joust `epialou 
look (at) the boy 
gousht eah pi-alou 
Cwtem `epi`slyl 
listen (to) the prayer 
soateam eah pi-eshleel 
Areh `epiws 
study the lesson 
areah eah pi-oash 
 
(B) All other verbs take the object sign `n 
 
[I `noutotc 
take a chair 
chi en ou-tots 
Cw `noumwou 
drink water 
soah en ou-moa-ou 
 
When a noun starts with one of these letters p, m, v, b, the object sign `m is 
used instead of `n. Note that the beginning of a noun is usually a definite or 
indefinite article. 
 
Ouwst `m`p[oic 
worship the Lord 
ou-woasht em epchois 
`slyl `m`vnou] 
pray (to) God 
eshleel em efnouti 
Cob] `mpima 
prepare the place 
sovti em pimah 
 
(3) OTHER USES OF `m AND `n 
 
(A) To mean “of”, which is a preposition that connects its noun with the 
preceding noun, adjective, or adverb. Again, the choice of `m or `n depends on 
the first letter of the second noun. There is, however, the preposition `nte, 
which also means “of”, and is used freely regardless of the starting letter of 
the noun that follows it. 
 
`vran `m `viwt 
the name of the father 
efraan em efyoat 
Piouyb `m piervei 
the priest of the altar 
pi-ou-weep em pi-erfeay 
Pisw `nte `viom 
the sand of the sea 
pishoah enteah efyom 
 
(B) In conjunction with an adjective. As you know, an adjective is a word that 
describes a quality, or that defines or limits a noun, e.g. “yellow”, “great”. 
 
Pijwm `mberi

pigoam emveari

Pirwmi `ncabe

pi-roami ensaveh 
Ounou] `nouwt 
one God 
ounouti en-ouwoat 
Piwnq `n`eneh 
the eternal life 
pi-oankh en eneah 
 
Note the adjective comes after the noun in Coptic. Some adjectives come 
before the noun, and in this case they take over the definite or the indefinite 
article of the noun. 
 
Pinis] `nouro 
the great king 
pinishti en ouroh

UNIT 3 
 
In this unit we shall learn the definite articles of single feminine and plural 
nouns, and present you with simple parts of the liturgy. A few sentences and 
expressions of every day use will also be included. 
 
(1) The definite article for single feminine nouns is ]. There are also two 
‘special’ articles commonly used in religious context. These are `t and `;. 
 
]seri 
the girl/daughter 
ti sheari 
]jom 
the power 
ti gom 
]`chimi 
the woman 
ti eshimi 
]anavora 
the liturgy 
ti anaforah 
]`triac 
the Trinity 
ti etrey yas 
]agia 
the (lady) saint 
ti agey ya 
]par;enoc 
the Virgin 
ti parthanos 
]soury 
the censer 
ti shouree 
]ourw 
the queen 
ti ouroah 
]bwki 
the slave/servant 
ti voaki 
]ek`klycia

et sheari 
`tve 
the heaven 
et feah 
`;nyb 
the lady 
ethneeb 
`;mau 
the mother 
ethmav 
 
(2) The definite article for plural nouns is ni. While in English, there is no 
indefinite article; in Coptic we have han, for plural nouns, which means 
“some”. 
 
Hanrwmi 
men 
Nirwmi 
the men 
Hanseri 
girls 
Niseri 
the girls 
Hanma 
places 
nima 
the places 
 
Most nouns do not change in the plural, though the articles change. Some 
nouns do however change.

the kings 
ni ou roa ou 
Pialou à nialwou`i 
the boys 
ni aloa ou wi 
`viwt à niio] 
the fathers 
ni ioti 
 
(3) The words for the pronouns “who”, “whom”, and “that”, are vyet, for the 
singular masculine, ;yet for the singular feminine, nyet for the plural and 
et for any of them. 
 
Pirwmi vyetcaji (etcaji) 
the man who speaks 
]`chimi ;yetvici (etvici) 
the woman who cooks 
Nirwmi nyet`slyl (et`slyl) 
the men who pray 
Vyethemci hijen pi`;ronoc 
who sits on the throne 
Nyetswni `nte pilaoc 
who are sick in the people (the sick in 
the people) 
 
(4) SIMPLE PARTS OF THE LITURGY 
 
Qen `vran `m`viwt nem `psyri nem pi`pneuma e;ouab ounou] `nouwt 
amyn. 
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the One God amen. 
 
The chant (qen `vran) 
 
Qen `vran `m`viwt nem `psyri nem pi`pneuma e;ouab ]`triac e;ouab 
`nomooucioc aXiac aXiac aXiac ]agia maria ]par;enoc aXioc 
aXioc aXioc pa[oic `pouro georgioc. 
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the constitutional Holy 
Trinity worthy, worthy, worthy the saint Virgin Mary worthy, worthy, worthy my 
lord the king George. 
 
Note 
 
(i) aXiac (axey yas) means “worthy” for the singular feminine, and aXioc is 
“worthy” for the singular masculine. You might have noticed the same pattern 
for agioc and agia, meaning “saint”. These nouns and adjectives are Greek 
words, where -oc is the end for singular masculine, and -ia, -iac for singular 
feminine. 
 
(ii) pa, ta,  na are possessive adjectives of the 1st person singular e.g. 
pa[oic “my lord”, ta[oic “my lady”, and na[oic “my lords”.

D – Important notes 
 
Pe, te and ne mean “is” for the singular masculine, singular feminine and 
“are” for the plural. These verbs are mainly descriptive, e.g. as to say “He is a 
man”. 
 
Ef,y, ec,y and eu,y (literally mean “present” or “placed”) and efsop, 
ecsop and eusop (literally mean “being”, “dwelling” or “present”), are used 
to mean “is”, “is” and “are” when talking about position, as seen in the 
previous examples.

UNIT 5 
 
(1) VERBS IN PRESENT TENSE 
 
]caji 
I speak 
ti saji 
`kcaji 
you speak (sing. masc.) 
ek saji 
Tecaji 
you speak (sing. fem.) 
teh saji 
`fcaji 
he speak 
ef saji 
`ccaji 
she speak 
es saji 
tencaji 
we speak 
tean saji 
tetencaji 
you speak (plur.) 
teatean saji 
cecaji 
they speak 
seah saji 
 
(A) Most of the Coptic verbs are regular, in the sense that the ends of the 
verbs do not change. 
 
(B) The subject pronouns ], `k, te, `f, `c, ten, teten and ce, unlike the case 
in English, join the verb directly. Furthermore, they indicate in our example the 
person who ‘speaks’: I, you, he, she… but cannot be used separately, i.e. 
independent from the verb. The independent pronouns in Coptic are: 
 
Anok 
I 
anok 
`n;ok 
you (sing. masc.) 
enthok 
`n;o 
you (sing. fem.) 
entho 
`n;of 
he 
enthof 
`n;oc 
she 
enthos 
Anon 
we 
anon 
`n;wten 
you (plur.) 
enthoatean 
`n;wou 
they 
enthoa ou 
 
(C) To negate a verb, an is placed after it. 
 
]caji 
I speak 
]caji an 
I do not speak 
]`slyl 
I pray 
]`slyl an 
I do not pray 
]ka] 
I understand 
]ka] an 
I do not 
understand 
`fouwm 
he eats 
`fouwm an 
he does not eat 
tenouws 
we want 
Tenouws an 
we do not want 
 

--- Page 19 ---
 
19
(D) In English, we use either a noun like the “boy”, “people”, “Peter”, “apple” 
etc., or a pronoun – we cannot use both of them together. So we say “the boy 
eats” or “he eats” but cannot say “the boy he eats”. In Coptic the subject 
pronoun is used in the presence of the subject noun. 
 
Pialou `fjerjer 
The boy plays 
Pi alou ef geargear 
]`chimi `ccaji an 
The woman does not 
speak 
Ti eshimi essaji an 
Cami nem petroc 
cecaji 
Sami and Petros speak 
Sami nem petros seah 
saji 
 
(E) The future tense is similar to the present tense, apart from the addition of 
na to the subject pronouns ], `k, te, `f… 
 
]nacaji 
I will speak 
`knacaji 
you will speak (sing. masc.) 
Tenacaji 
you will speak (sing. fem.) 
`fnacaji 
he will speak 
`cnacaji 
she will speak 
Tennacaji 
we shall speak 
Tetennacaji 
you will speak (plur.) 
cenacaji 
they will speak

`eniou`w hi 
(pitelenau)? 
shall you (plur.) watch 
the news on the TV? 
teateanna soms eah ni

(F) How to ask questions 
 
In the last two examples, you have noticed that the structure of the sentence 
has not changed. Like the case in French and colloquial Arabic, you just 
change the tone of voice to inquire about something e.g. `kouws? “do you 
want?”, `kna`I? “are you coming?”. In addition, the question article my could be 
added to the sentence, again without change in the structure of the sentence. 
So, the previous questions will be my `kouws? and my `kna`i? 
 
`kouws 
`eouwm ]nou? 
do you want to eat now?
ek ou woash eah ou 
woam tinou 
Ce ]ouws 
`eouwm ]nou. 
yes, I want to eat now 
seah ti ou woash eah ou

do you think (that) the 
doctor will come 
tomorrow? 
ekmeav e je piseeni

]meu`I an je `fna`i 
I do not think (that) he 
will come 
timev e an je efna e

UNIT 6 
 
(1) DIFFERENT IMPERATIVE FORMS 
 
We have seen that most verbs do not change when used in the imperative i.e. 
when used for a request or to give an order. 
 
Examples of verbs given before are: 
 
Hemci 
to sit/sit 
Ouwm 
to eat/eat 
Areh 
to keep/to study/keep/study 
 
And examples of recently studies verbs: 
 
[i 
to take/take 
Ws 
to read/read 
,w 
to put/put 
,w ebol/,a ebol 
to forgive/forgive (literally “put 
outside”) 
Swp 
to buy/to accept/buy/accept 
Cwoun 
to know/know 
 
However, the two frequently used verbs mentioned in the last unit `I “to come” 
and se meaning “to go” have special imperative forms. The same applies to 
the common verb ] which means “to give”. 
 
(A) `I “to come”: in the imperative form 
 
Amou 
come (sing. masc.) 
Amy 
come (sing. fem.) 
Amwini 
come (plur.) 
 
(B) se “to go”: in the imperative form 
 
masenak 
go (sing. masc.) 
masene 
go (sing. fem.) 
masenwten 
go (plur.) 
 
(C) ] “to give”: in the imperative form 
 

--- Page 24 ---
 
24
Moi (moy) 
give (sing. masc., sing. fem., plur.) 
 
Examples of these three important verbs: 
 
Amou `mnai ebol ha 
pek`hmot 
come here if you please 
amou emnay eavol ha 
peak ehmot 
Amy `eqoun ebol ha 
pe`hmot 
come in if you please 
amee eah khoun eavol 
ha peah ehmot 
Amwini `e payi ebol

come to my house, if 
you please 
amoay ni eah pa ee 
eavol ha peatean ehmot 
 
Moi nan `ntekhiryny 
give us your peace 
moy nan enteak

Moi nyi `noucoucou

moy nee en ou sousou 
Moi nyi `n]soury 
give me the censer 
moy nee en ti shouree 
Moi `nni`hryri `etekmau
give the flowers to your 
mother 
moy en ni ehreeri eah 
teak mav 
 
Masenak `e]baki 
`nrac] 
go to the city tomorrow 
masheanak eah tivaki

Masene ebol ha 
paima 
get out of this place 
masheaneah eavol ha

Masenwten `e 
`psemmo qen 
piansasf e;nyou 
go abroad next week 
masheah noatean eah 
epshemmo khean pi 
anshashf eathnee you 
 
In the next unit, we shall learn about more verbs that have special imperative 
forms. 
 
(2) The Coptic language is unique in having a special way to put the 
imperative form of verbs in a ‘polite’ presentation. In this form, you do not 
have to say “please”. It is also used in prayers, to express hope and 
inspiration for the prayers to be heard and accepted. A third use of this form is 
to mean “let”. 
 
maricaji 
let me speak 
marekcaji 
would you speak (sing. masc.) 
marecaji 
would you speak (sing. fem.) 
marefcaji 
let him speak 
marecaji 
let her speak 
marencaji 
let us speak 

--- Page 25 ---
 
25
maretencaji 
would you speak (plur.) 
maroucaji 
let them speak 
 
(A) General examples 
 
Marenhemci qen 
(picalwn)

room 
marean heamsi khean

Maretenhemci

(B) In prayers 
 
Marensep`hmot `ntotf `mpireferpe;nanef ouoh `nnayt@ `vnou] 
`viwt `mpen[oic ouoh pennou] ouoh pencwtyr iycouc pi`,rictoc. 
Let us give thanks to the Gracious and Merciful God, the Father of our Lord, 
God and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
mareansheap ehmot entotf empi reafear peath naneaf ouwoh enna eet 
efnouti efyoat empean tchois ouwoh peannouti ouwoh pean soateer eesous pi

Marenouwst `mpencwtyr pimairwmi `naga;oc. 
Let us worship our Saviour, the ‘Good’ Lover-of-mankind. 
marean ouwoasht empean soateer pimay roami en aghathos 
 
You may have noticed the word sep`hmot `ntotf meaning “to thank him”. 
This is a compound word, made of: sep from swp which means “accept”, 
`hmot, that means “grace”, and the object pronoun `ntotf which means “from 
his hand”. 
 
In Coptic, there are many of these compound verbs. It is worth learning the 
word tot which means “hand”, the way it changes as an object pronoun and 
some of the verbs it forms. 
 
Tot 
my hand 
Totk 
your hand (sing. masc.) 
To] 
your hand (sing. fem.) 
Totf 
his hand 
Totc 
her hand

which literally means “he will put his hand on”.

the TV? 
`mmon> ]nacomc an `ewou 
no, I shall not watch (them) 
 
As you remember, `e also means “to” and comes also with the verb hw] that 
means “should”. The dealing of `e is the same. 
 
`n`;nau `knase `e`psemmo `e 
amerika? (en eathnav eknasheah 
eah epsemmoah eah amerrika) 
when shall you travel to America?

Ha also means “to” and “until”, e.g. 
 

--- Page 30 ---
 
30
`fnatas;o* (efna tasto) ha pefyi 
he will return to his home 
 
* When ; follows c, it sounds like t t.

]naswpi harok `nrac] 
I’ll be with you (at your home) 
tomorrow 
`wli `mpekjwnt ebol haron

Sarof 
harof 
Saroc

(3) THE PAST TENSE 
 
(A) The simple past tense is constructed by the addition of ai, ak, are, af, 
ac, an, areten, and au. 
 
aiouwm

Akouwm 
you ate (sing. masc.) 
Areouwm 
you ate (sing. fem.) 
Afouwm 
he ate 
Acouwm 
she ate 
Anouwm 
we ate 
Aretenouwm 
you ate (plur.) 
auouwm 
they ate 
 
Some examples: 
 
Af`I ouoh afcw] `mmon

nef`hbyoou`I (neaf ehvi ou we) 
I was talking to the man about his 
business 
Nafqerqer sa `atoou`i

(C) The perfect past tense is used with the simple or continuous past. It tells 
the action of its verb. It is frequently translated “when…” or “as…” It is made 
as follows: etai, etak, etare, etaf, etac, etan, etareten, and etau. 
 
(D) General examples employing the three past forms

Lesson 11-B
The Rule of the JINKIM { ` }

--- Page 221 ---
The Jinkim is the accent mark that is 
placed on Coptic letters to indicate 
pronunciation.
The Rule of the Jinkim:
I. When Jinkim comes over a vowel 
letter, it splits the word, because the 
letter must be pronounced by itself.

--- Page 226 ---
II. When Jinkim comes over a 
consonant letter, an e sound 
proceeds the letter.
For Example:
`t = et
`b = ev
`k = ek
`z = ez
`m = em
`q = ekh
`n = en
`s = etch
`d = ed 
`r = er

Lesson 18
The Preposition ‘Of’

--- Page 269 ---
• The preposition ‘of’ comes between two 
nouns to indicate: 
– possession of the second to the first. 
• “the book of Mark” → Mark owns the book
– ‘objective genitive’ (the direct object of the action is 
contained in another noun)
• “the love of God” (God doesn’t own the love. He is 
actually the loved one not the lover in this context) 
– expressing quality or quantity 
• “A man of action”, “a speed of 40 mph”
• In Coptic, 8`nte serves the preposition:
– abba M/na n~te nivaiat : Abba Mena of (the) Bayad

--- Page 270 ---
Preposition Rules
1. `nte can be shortened to `n and attached 
to the beginning of the second noun. 
– y~mau n~te I/couc → y~mau n~I/couc
2. If the second noun start with one of the 
letters (b y m p v ') `m is used. 
–
~Ps/ri n~te V] → ~Ps/ri m~V]
3. If the first noun is plural, and `n or `m are 
used, the definite article of the first noun 
is changed from ni to nen
–
nis/ri n~te nirwmi → nens/ri n~nirwmi

Lesson 21 
Coptic Months
• All Prayers and Rites in the Coptic church are based on 
the Coptic Calendar.
• The Egyptian calendar preceded the church by 
thousands of years and is the only calendar that our 
church has ever used. 
• The Julian calendar is an adaptation of the Egyptian 
calendar that was introduced by Julius Caesar, with the 
aid of an Alexandrian astronomer, in 46 B.C. 
• The Gregorian calendar takes its name from Pope 
Gregory XIII of Rome, who adjusted and dropped 10 
days from the Julian calendar in 1582 based on scientific 
findings.

Lesson 23 
Possessive Adjectives
• Possessive adjectives describe belonging or 
ownership:
– my, your, our, its, his, her, and their
• In Coptic, possessive adjectives consist of 
two parts. 
– The first part is one of the letters to tell whether 
the noun is singular masculine (P), 
singular feminine(T) or plural (N)
– The second part explains who possesses: e.g.
a= first person singular, en= first person plural
– Paiwt = my father -- Peniwt = our father

COPTIC LEXICAL 
INFLUENCE 
ON EGYPTIAN 
ARABIC 
WILSON B. BISHAI, 
School of Advanced International Studies, 
The Johns Hopkins University, Washington, D.C. 
EGYPTIAN Arabic 
has acquired 
numerous lexical items from practically all 
the languages with which it has come in 
contact. 
Coptic was among 
the 
more 
important of those languages to influence 
the Egyptian Arabic vocabulary, especially 
that of Upper Egyptian. In everyday life 
the Egyptians use a number of expressions 
without the slightest notion that they are 
repeating words which can be traced back 
to Coptic and ancient 
Egyptian. 
The 
following 
wintertime 
scene, 
typical 
of 
modern rural Egypt, 
provides 
a good 
illustration of this. As some peasant boys 
play their popular "Egyptian ball game"' 
they may repeat such common terms as 
JjW, awwal senno, which means "the 
first (movement) of the second (round)." 
j 
senno, which refers to the second round 
of the game, is taken from Coptic ct?as, 
"two." While the boys are playing, they get 
into an argument and one says to the other 
,a. 
J,. 
baldsh tahgzs, "quit bluffing." 
oA,r 
is a noun derived from 
, which 
in turn is a borrowing from Coptic paoooc, 
meaning "talkative." 
When the boys go 
home for supper they may eat cheese, and 
their mother may say p>- 
'.c 
z, di gibna 
halam, "This is cream cheese." f, 
which 
means "cheese," is Coptic 
a&XwJ^. 
The 
Coptic 
loanwords 
in 
Egyptian 
Arabic have been partially investigated 
by several writers among whom are G. 
Sobhy, W. Vycichl, and W. Worrell;2 but 
1 Egyptian 
peasant boys use balls made usually 
of socks stuffed with rags; they are frequently seen in 
streets and open fields playing this native ball game 
often referred to as 
kl 
t 
o.J 
kira sharab. 
2 G. Sobhy, Common Words in the Spoken Arabic 
of Egypt, pp. 4-15; W. H. Worrell, Coptic Texts, pp. 
39 
the validity of these words has never been 
determined. 
Many lexical 
items 
which 
have been listed by these writers as Coptic 
loanwords in Egyptian Arabic are plainly 
pure Arabic, while others can be attributed 
to Turkish, Persian, or one of the languages 
which came in contact 
with Egyptian 
Arabic after the Coptic period. The writer 
has collected two hundred and five lexical 
items, all of which were suggested 
by 
various scholars to be Coptic loanwords in 
Egyptian Arabic. Of these only the one 
hundred and nine items treated in this 
article are considered as valid loanwords. 
Fifty-eight are best explained as being of 
Arabic origin; eight as originating from 
sources 
other 
than 
Coptic 
or Arabic; 
fourteen 
are of uncertain 
origins; and 
sixteen have no reference to source in the 
standard Coptic dictionary by Crum. 
The following one hundred and nineteen 
do not include proper nouns or words 
borrowed from Greek origins, since such 
items are not directly related to the study 
at hand. The items treated are arranged 
alphabetically 
according 
to the 
trans- 
literation of the Egyptian 
Arabic words 
into the English alphabet. When a certain 
writer is the only source of any citation, 
his name is quoted between parentheses. 
VALID COPTIC LOANWORDS 
T a, "yes," SB a'a, 
"yea." Coptic 
2 
was dropped causing the lengthening 
of 
the vowel. 
329-42. 
Worrell included material collected 
by W. 
Vycichl. See also W. Spiegelberg, Koptisches Hand- 
worterbuch, p. 339; and A. Erman, 
Worterbuch der 
aegyptischen Sprache, VI, 222-42.

OF NEAR EASTERN 
STUDIES 
-i 
ajbiya, "a prayer book for the 
Copts," S 
a) 
nI 
(pl.), "hours." .i 
follows 4Lj, which is a broken plural in 
Arabic whose singular is J,i, 
such as 
,', 
raghif-arghifa, "loaf of bread." The 
Coptic apparently was borrowed into the 
nearest Arabic broken plural pattern. 
JT, 'dl, "a game of pebbles (Sobhy)," 
B a&, "pebble." 
4.ij 'amandi, "hell," dahya twadik(i) 
I'amandi (Sobhy), "May a tragedy take 
you to hell"; BF a?rt^1-, SA art-rC, 
"hades" or literally "the western place." 
Egyptian Arabic amandi is not frequent 
in Egypt; L.-l 
e- gahannam(i) Igharb, 
"the hell of the West," is very common 
and possibly a literal translation of the 
original meaning of aAr{T-. The voicing 
of t in 6-Ji is quite normal after a voiced 
obstruent such as n. 
J.i amnut, "sexton (Vycichl)," SBAF 
AMIOr'T, "porter, doorkeeper." The hamza 
in Arabic is prosthetic. 
Lj; anba, "title for Coptic priests," B 
a&a. S ana (from Aramaic). The phonet- 
ic change is most likely caused by partial 
dissimilation which developed this way: 
'abba > 'amba > 'anba. However, Damba 
is also used. It is possible to attribute .lA 
to Aramaic abba, "father," or any other 
Semitic language cognate, but since it is 
used only with Coptic priests, it is most 
probable that it was borrowed from Coptic. 
JIL bdg, "the portion of the field left for 
cultivating clover or beans," possibly from 
S rnooa, noK, 
naKx, "fragment." The 
change in meaning involves specialization, 
but the sound changes are normal. 
,J. 
baglula, "bubble," SB neK~RX&w . 
with the article "pitcher" or "jar." Possibly 
the relationship in meaning is due to the 
air bubbles caused when a pitcher is filled 
with water. The Coptic was borrowed as a 
collective noun whose singular -IL. refers 
to one of the kind, such as . 
shajar, 
"trees," and ;sh shajara, "one tree." 
jjl. 
bagrur, "frog (Upper Egyptian)," 
S neKposp 
with the definite article, "the 
frog." The Arabic followed the quadri- 
literal pattern J_L such as j.,? 
tartuir, 
"tassel." It was first borrowed into Upper 
Egyptian 
Arabic, then taken 
over by 
Cairene Arabic as j. b ba'rir. 
jo.. bagiiti, "small basket," used mainly 
in Middle Egypt, S nKoT with the definite 
article 
rn(). 
The unaspirated 
value of 
Coptic t at the close of a syllable ap- 
parently sounded to the Arabic ear as ti. 
*. balham, "to bluff," S B^\a?o*, 
"Blemmye, 
name 
of 
some 
barbarian 
people dwelling in the Christian period on 
the East of the Nile south of Philae." The 
Blemmye 
people were known for their 
bluffing. 
AJL. balshum, "heron," S nrTAowA with 
the definite 
article, 
"the heron." 
The 
change of 6 to f is normal since both are 
voiced bilabials. 
v. 
barsim, "clover or alfalfa," 
SB 
f pc-I&, "clover." The Arabic vocalization 
followed the pattern with a quadriliteral 
root, such as a..^ 
'afrit, "devil." 
j..,. 
basharosh, "flamingo" 
(Spiro), 
S rtT-op?p 
pcfw , "the thing which is 
red," made up of nT.T, "that which (is)," 
and -rTpYJpwJ, "red." Worrell suggests 
that basharosh developed from *bashsharosh 
< *badsharosh < *badrashrosh < *badtrash- 
rosh < nTr-opjppWoWi.3 
U. bikh, "a word used by children when 
they try to frighten each other," B nrS, 
"the demon." 
4.. 
birba, "site of a ruined temple," 
S nrpn?, "the temple," which is prt1 with 
the definite article n((). 
oLj bisdra, "cooked beans," possibly 
from *rticCap 
a compound of ntC. (con- 
struct form of rnic), "to cook," and apw, 
"beans." The Arabic followed a regular 
4Jl pattern such as ?.uj, riwdya, "story." 
3 Worrell, op. cit., p. 333 
40

COPTIC LEXICAL INFLUENCE ON EGYPTIAN ARABIC 
4 
biskha, "part of a plough" (Vy- 
cichl), "edge of a plough" (Sobhy), 
B nuc6o with the definite article, "plough 
handle." Coptic final o was assimilated to 
the feminine termination -a with the 
shift of stress to the first syllable. The pat- 
tern is 4.L, such as .,f fikra, "idea." 
.jyij bshobesh, "a call of welcome 
during country weddings," SB ntlonc 
(with the definite article ri(?), "reception, 
entertainment." This example indicates 
the progressive assimilation of Coptic c to 
Arabic J 
which rendered the word 
bshobesh. A parallel example of this is 
&8 shams, "sun," which in Upper Egypt 
is pronounced 
8 shamsh. 
bJi. buri, "a kind of fish," S 
oWp?, 
"fish, nurgil cephalus" (Crum). The sound 
changes 
are normal; 
and 
the 
Arabic 
equated 
well with the pattern 
J 
(,ij 
plus the nisbe s) of a hollow root such as 
J-i, rmri, 
"a turkey." 
.r 
bursh, "mat made of palm leaves," 
rwp!Y, "to spread" or "something which is 
spread," such as a mat. Possibly Tntpfiy is 
related to Semitic prsh, or Arabic j 
with the same meaning. However, 
. 
can- 
not come from L., and therefore a Coptic 
origin for it is clearly indicated. 
by. bush, "porridge" (Vycichl), S Irroosgy, 
B niwo'sy with the definite article "gruel." 
The Arabic followed 
the pattern 
of a 
media-weak noun such as L5 ftl, "beans." 
o. 
damira, 
"time 
of inundation," 
S TtAHop 
with 
the feminine 
article 
rT, 
"high water, 
inundation." 
The Arabic 
followed the 
'4A pattern such as 
4.. 
tariqa, "way." The voicing of t is normal 
(cf. 'amandi). 
.- 
dabbah, "a wooden 
door lock," 
S 'rTnw with the definite article. Egyp- 
tian Arabic follows the tJ 
pattern after 
doubling the Coptic second consonant in 
order to form a triliteral root. Coptic T is 
expected to yield Arabic -1, t: the voicing 
of t to d is anomalous. 
ZJ falt, "buttocks" (Sobhy), SB flhTrs, 
"thigh, 
hip." The Arabic followed 
the 
J.' pattern such as 
:J- 
dars, "lesson." 
Coptic tll'r 
is uncertain; it occurs once.4 
jji farfar "to flap the wings, especially 
when the bird is falling down," B qopqcp, 
"to fall, rush down." However, it might 
be a metathesized 
form of Arabic -JP 
rafraf (see below). 
Jj fatt, "to jump or run," SAF TIWT, "to 
flee." The velarization of Tr is normal owing 
to its unaspirated nature; and the Arabic 
followed the pattern of a double Cain verb 
such as f marr, "to pass." From the root 
ft!, ' 
Ui, fattat is derived meaning "spring- 
like." 
j fiuta, "towel," S qcwTr, "to wipe." 
The changes are normal (see under e.. 
tuba). 
o 
a 
gashwa, "a fish" (Crum), S KRalov, 
"among fish." 
KAJO'T was 
apparently 
borrowed first as yA. gashw, which is a 
collective 
noun form, such as 
; naml, 
"ants." The feminine of such a form is 
usually 
a singular 
noun 
such 
as 
d1 
namla, 
"an ant." 
Accordingly, 
gashwa 
can be derived from gashw to mean "a 
fish." 
J 
gil, "a kind of fish," B KHJ-, 
"a 
fish." The borrowing 
is quite normal. 
JUL shial with the same meaning developed 
from the Sahidic form 
1h?. 
(,.L 
hajjds, "garrulous" or "talkative" 
as in Dinta wad hajjds, "You are a talkative 
boy," 
aNsOOCc, "the one who talks." The 
Coptic expression is made up of pa, "pre- 
fix for first perfective,"5 
2sO 
"to say 
(bound form)," and c, "it." The Arabic 
followed 
the pattern 
of the 
intensive 
participle 
I Conjugation 
JLd such 
as 
I.l:4 kazzab, "liar." A root hjs was formed 
and other words were derived such as 
4 W. E. Crum, A Coptic Dictionary, p. 38. 
5 Ibid., p. 635; and also W. E. Crum, "Some 
Further Meletian Documents," 
JEA, 
XIII 
(1927), 
p. 21.

,,, 
""to bluff by talking," and 
.-, 
"bluffing." 
,. 
hallius, "cobweb," SB ~a.osc, 
"spider's web." Coptic p may be borrowed 
in Arabic as either h or h. The Arabic 
followed the JS pattern such as 
fij, 
"the holy one." 
o~ 
hammas or hemmis, "to sit (Vy- 
cichl)," S tAooc, 
"to sit, dwell, remain " 
Hammas is a regular II Conjugation form 
such as . 
8 sharrab, "to give to drink"; 
hemmis is a dialectal variant of hammas. 
J.y 
hawjal, 
"anchor" 
(Sobhy), 
B

or 
A?T2SaA. The Arabic fol- 
lowed a quadriliteral pattern such as .iC. 
bakraj, "tea pot." 
o!. 
hawwash, "to bluff, mostly by 
talking roughly," S Poo*T, "to abuse or 
insult." The Arabic followed the II Con- 
jugation pattern of the root hwsh, from 
which other words were derived such as 
.4jr, "bluffing," and ;2i, "bluffer." 
A 
heba, "a bird" (Sobhy), SF >26cwt, 
"the ibis bird." 
- 
hnayye, 
"matter,

"some(thing)." Metathesis of Coptic y and 
n renders honye which became hnayye 
following a diminutive Arabic pattern 
such as .r bnayye, "small girl." 
f." 
.halum, "cream cheese," SAB 
PAcWX, "cheese." The change of Coptic 
o to Egyptian Arabic f is normal. 
J-"- 
.handus, "lizard" (Sobhy), B 
tAKtTOC 
with the same meaning. The 
voicing of T is normal. 
.jj 
hantuir, "carriage drawn by 
horses," SF 
T)rxp, 
"horses." Possibly 
Coptic unaspirated t sounded to the Arabic 
ear as a doubled sound which later 
developed to nt. 
p! idda, "he gave," a q yiddi, "he 
gives," s9! 
'iddi, "give (imp.)," SB ', "to 
give." The form J3! is rather problematic 
in Arabic because it does not fit any of the 
known verbal patterns. If it is considered 
a corrupted form of classical Arabic 
Jal 'actd with the same meaning, 'atta or 
Danta is expected; the latter form is used 
in Iraq. Moreover, Egyptian 
Arabic 
vocabulary includes 
c 'a.ta, "to give." 
If as! is considered original in Arabic 
stemming from roots such as 
\J or 's. 
the form of the imperfective does not seem 
to fit any of them. On the other hand, a 
Coptic origin from ' 
is feasible after 
certain normal changes that might have 
taken place. S 'j ti (unaspirated) may 
have become di and possibly was first 
borrowed in Arabic as an imperative 'iddi 
with 'i as a prefix (which is a normal 
feature of Arabic) and with doubling the 
d to equate it with a triliteral tertia weak 
root such as :-! 'irmi, "throw" (imp.). 
The imperfect yiddi was also formed such 
as J- yirmi, "he throws." The perfect 
form, however, is problematic; 
as' 
dada 
like ui rama is the form which is ex- 
pected, but such a form (with a double a 
root) is very uncommon in Arabic. There- 
fore, a IV Conjugation form 
:! "idda 
was used for the perfect form. 
~.r 
jalldbiyya, "garment, the main 
dress of the Egyptian fellahin," S cro^he, 
"garment of wool." Here is a case where 
Coptic 6 was borrowed as Arabic 9; 
Coptic 
r may be borrowed as Upper 
Egyptian 
.. The Coptic word supplied a 
root '9 J . in Arabic from which a noun 
was formed after the pattern ZS 
such 
as 
;-", "blanket." 
It might be noted here that classical 
Arabic has ..L. 
julbdb, "garment." 
However, there is no need for Egyptian 
Arabic to change it to 4- 
since its 
pattern occurs frequently such as lW, 
"slippers," and JiJ. 
"ankle bracelets." 
It is possible that .i 
might have been 
derived from 4'-. 
c. jay, "a call for help" such as jay ya 
'wldd jay, "help, boys, help!" OTsaI, 
"safety, health." The Arabic did not 
borrow the first syllable in Coptic perhaps 
42

COPTIC LEXICAL INFLUENCE ON EGYPTIAN ARABIC 
because it was considered the Arabic 
conjunction j, or the Coptic indefinite 
article o0. 
Ja;S- juks, "crepitus ventris." "This 
utterance is used in Upper Egypt; 
A 
gis is its equivalent in Lower Egypt. The 
Coptic origin is B WSOKC, 
"crepitus ventris" 
(Crum). The last i vowel was eliminated 
in Egyptian Arabic, perhaps it was 
considered a case ending; the velarization 
is anomalous. 
A?, 
i 
ka'ka, "cake" S RaH?. This word 
is problematic owing to the existence of 
the c sound. It may be attributed to Coptic 
as well as to Persian SJL, "biscuit or dry 
bread," which may be related to the Indo- 
European origin of English "cake." Clas- 
sical Arabic dictionaries list 1S 
but 
indicate that it is foreign. The writer is 
inclined to attribute AS,- to Coptic and 
consider the existence of c a kind of 
hypercorrection in Arabic perhaps en- 
couraged by other Coptic pronunciations 
such as 5aa<3e (Crum), with a double 
vowel. 
dJi 
l kdkula, "outer garment," S 
KOWKW&, "hood, cowl of monks." 
The 
Arabic followed the pattern 4JL such 
as A4-L samula, "screw nut." 
.S kalaj (present tense .... 
byukluj), 
"to limp," SB RKW S, "to be bent." The 
Arabic followed a regular I Conjugation 
pattern from the root k I j. 
Ufi kaluh, "the corn cob after it is 
beaten to gather the kernels," S KRxW , 
"to strike." The Arabic followed a J<+ 
pattern such as f'-" rahum, "merciful." 
_e 
kds, "misfortune" or "pain," 
usually used by women during a funeral 
such as 
L( b 
LJ J. , "0 my distress, 0 
my misfortune," SB RHC, qualitative of 
"burial or corpse" (Sobhy mentions KAC, 
"pain" with no reference). 
5 kekh, "dirty," S KA&, "soil, earth." 
The borrowing of Coptic e as Arabic : is 
very unusual, a fact which casts some 
doubt on this otherwise satisfactory 
etymology. 
J 
labis, "a kind of fish," S katHC, 
"fish cyprinus niloticus" (Crum). The 
borrowed form is normal. 
. lajj, "to be persistent," S &o3, "be 
impudent, persistent." The Arabic fol 
lowed a double cain pattern such as 
t 
marr, "to pass." 
0U libdn, "ship's cable," SB 
^6aMH. 
The Arabic followed a J4L pattern such 
as 
l.' kitdb, "book." The Coptic word 
itself, however, is of obscure origin. 
J lubsh, "a kind of prayer" (Vycichl), 
SB W JA , "a crown," used to refer to a 
final stanza in certain hymns. The vocalic 
change is regular. 
J.L.U majur, "a pot for kneading," 
perhaps S AA2~wp which is made up of 
aA, "place," and 2mp, "scatter." Although 
<aA2cp does not appear in Coptic dic- 
tionaries as one word, it is possible that 
jr-L might have developed from a col- 
loquial Coptic term which was not stated 
in any literary record. The phonetic 
transition is regular and it must have been 
borrowed in Upper Egyptian Arabic and 
then taken over to Cairene as magiir. 
-... 
marisi, "southerly," used for 
wind, SBF ApHic, 
"southern country." 
This is a clear case in which the Coptic 
noun was borrowed with the addition of 
the Arabic relational suffix i to form an 
adjective. 
.. mbui, "water to drink," usually said 
to children, S n&oov with the masculine 
definite article n(e), "water." Here there 
is a clear case of metathesis between Tn 
and *. after the voicing of n. 
c,, 
mihyds, 
"fanfaron, boaster, 
blusterer," perhaps *^^?I,WC., 
"full of 
hurry," which is made up of ^,, 
"'full," 
and McI(c, "speed" or "hurry." It is 
possible that 
i dropped, thus leaving 
AeIlc, 
which may have become Arabic 
M.l+. The Arabic followed the pattern JUL, 
43 

--- Page 7 ---
JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 
such as JLSZ mikydl, "measure." Other 
related forms were derived such as 
hayyas (II Conjugation), "to make noise," 
and <^a hesa, "a noise." 
jL. mnaw, "thither" (Sobhy), B A^MH, 
"there." The diphthong dw was possibly 
caused by the influence of 
tAa^T, "there." 
s.l 
mndy, "hither" (Sobhy), B ^AtaI 
"here." 
,sL.; nabdri, "the winter crop of maize," 
S 
tAnprTp "grain." Arabic nabdri is the 
broken plural of . nabr, such as \; 
- 
,- 11 'ard-aarddi, "territory." Possibly 
the Coptic was borrowed first as singular 
from which the plural was derived and 
became more common. 
JU ndf, "yoke" (Sobhy) SAB a{t6, 
"yoke." The h-sound dropped and the 
preceding vowel was lengthened. 
i nagra (Upper Egyptian), "heat of 
the day," perhaps from *HARKpH, "strong 
sun," from S r ,H) 
"strong" and pH, 
"sun." 
,.y nannus, "delicate, nice, mignonne," 
SAF rtarosc, 
"it is nice," made up of 
Saruor, "nice or fair" and the suffix c, 
third person feminine used impersonally. 
J; nfush, "big" (Sobhy), S AoO, "great" 
or "big." The Arabic followed a 
i 
pattern of a hollow verb such as sr sur, 
"fence." 
4. 
niisha, "fever, especially typhoid," 
S 
X0ooUJy with unknown 
meaning 
but 
parallel with "stinking of disease." The 
Arabic pattern is <l: of a hollow root such 
as a.Y kura "ball." 
JUib raftdw, "a measure of grain which 
is one-fourth of a kela, used only in distant 
Upper Egypt," S paqToovT, "fraction of 
four or quarter." The velarization of ' is 
normal as well as the vocalic change from 
00s to dw. 
J.rv 
ramrum, "small 
fish" (Sobhy), 
possibly related to S pas, 
"fish, tilapia" 
(Crum). The borrowed Coptic stem was 
duplicated in Arabic and followed the 
J,j 
pattern 
such 
as 
!: 
tartur, 
"tassel." 
1; rdy, "a kind of fish," SB pKI, "a 
fish, alestes dentes" (Crum). 
A..; rita (also pronounced rita), "a plant, 
sapindus," B pITa, "a plant, flower of 
laurus nobilis." 
.t' samit, "special bread made of fine 
flour," SB cal'T, 
"fine flour." The more 
common Arabic form (also Persian) a 
samid, "white bread," appears to be a 
borrowing from Syriac samidd (itself 
from Akkadian samidu). Since the word is 
Semitic, Greek aoE-/LaALs is a borrowing, 
as is perhaps Latin simila. The Egyptian 
Arabic form samit must, because of the t, 
be from the Coptic, which in turn is a loan 
from some Semitic source. 
8" sds, "oakum," S CaaC?, "tow." 
The Arabic form is the colloquial of the 
classical J' pattern of a media-hamza 
root; the hamza is lost and the preceding 
vowel lengthens, cf. Jli fa'l, "omen," 
which becomes in colloquial JL fdl. 
j- 
senno, "the second round of the 
Egyptian peasants' ball game," SAB crts, 
"two." Perhaps the doubling of n was 
caused by the contraction of the diphthong. 
vuo. shabbura, "fog," perhaps from 
*fj6pH, "the change of the sun," from 
UjIB, "change" and pH, "sun." This is a 
case where & was borrowed in Arabic as 
.; 
the Arabic apparently borrowed a 
root . 
*shbr from which vo. 
shabbura 
was derived according to the pattern 
,J; such as u-. ballura, "crystal." 
Jl shdi, "fish"; see under J~ gil. 
cj- 
shallut, "a kick," B 
raXo2s, 
"foot." Possibly, shallut is a later pro- 
nunciation derived from shalluj (in Kena) 
and shallud (in Farshiit); the former is the 
closest to the Coptic origin, which was 
borrowed first perhaps as a noun .j 
shalij, and then the Arabic used the 
denominative form of the II Conjugation 
to serve as a verb sL h 
shallat, "to kick," 
44 

--- Page 8 ---

from which the secondary noun 
shallut was later derived. 
r 
h 
shamar or :l 
shamdr, "the 
fennel plant," S CA^&^HIP, "fennel." The 
change of Coptic s to Arabic sh is un- 
common, but sometimes distant Upper 
Egyptians pronounce the regular s as sh, 
such 
as 
- 
shams, "sun," which 
becomes 
A 
shamsh, and sa'al, "to 
ask," which becomes JL sha'al. Ca.a. hp 
was possibly borrowed first as jL. 
shamdhir, which is a broken plural form, 
the singular of which is :Lk shamhdr, 
such as kL' qatrdn, "tar," and its plural 
&.liJ qatdrin. The h in shamhdr, being 
weak, was dropped leaving shamdr; 
shamar is possibly a shortened form of sha- 
mdr. Although the original of CA^aA>Hp 
is as yet unknown, it is quite distinct from 
later Coptic ya^ap, a reborrowing from 
Arabic. 
LL shashd, "to rise," usually applied 
to the moon, stars and dawn, S ^!a, "to 
rise." The Coptic origin was duplicated in 
Arabic. 
Apparently 
shashd 
was 
first 
borrowed as sha'sha (which is still used) 
of the quadriliteral by duplication pattern. 
s shawshaw, "beat with a whip," 
SB 
OTOWJOTsy, 
"strike, 
thresh." 
The 
word has undergone a metathesis of the 
reduplicated 
root element 
wsh to shw. 
The Arabic form is that of a quadriliteral 
by duplication pattern. 
j: 
shhbdr, "wonder" used in saying 
J} :.- .: 
shbar shbdr 'alayya, "I 
have become a freak or a wonder" (Sobhy), 
S !JntpC, "wonder." 
,ll 
.shgilgil, 
"bell" 
(Vycichl), 
S 
J!RK&rKl&, "bell." 
.shilba, "a kind of fish," S &3&oov, 
"fish, silurus mystus" (Crum). Sometimes 
Coptic i is borrowed as . such as mchpo, 
which appears in Arabic as 8I 
shubra, 
"a place name." 
_ 
shinf, 
"sack 
for straw," 
S sHnoq 
or wcrtoq, 
"basket 
or crate." 
The Arabic 
followed the J;i pattern such as 
shibr, "a measure of length." Otherwise 
the changes are regular. 
.LA: shintydn, "large drawers out of 
mode" 
(Sobhy), 
B 
J!y^rT(, 
"robe 
of 
linen" (cf. Greek atvSwv). The Egyptian 
shndyt appears more original. 
- 
. 
shob, "heat of the day," 
B WJOnTI 
or 
ojTIn, 
"fire 
or to 
scorch." 
Usually 
Coptic w becomes u in Egyptian Arabic 
and not o, but in this case o was pro- 
nounced on account of the guttural 
P, 
which 
requires 
a 
back 
lower 
vowel. 
Otherwise the form is normal. 
?d 
shuna, "store house for grains," 
B 
J^Yt'C. 
pronounced 
approximately 
shewne. The change of ew to f seems 
regular, 
and the 
final a in Egyptian 
Arabic is the sign of feminine gender. 
".j, 
shuriya, "censor" (Sobhy), SBF 
UJovpH 
with the same meaning. 
The final 
ya might be for the purpose of giving a 
feminine ending to the Arabic word since 
the original Coptic is feminine. 
Sh 
shsha, 
"small 
window," 
SAB 
JOTyJTr, "window." 
Possibly 
the final 
T 
was 
considered 
a feminine 
ending 
in 
Arabic and was levelled to a, rendering 
shisha after the pattern 4L of a hollow 
verb such as oj_, kiira, "ball." 
&, 
shusha, 
"tuft 
of 
hair, 
crest," 
S 
rIc0)i, "single lock or plait of hair." 
Sahidic 2 may be borrowed in Arabic as 
f 
such as 
?6Bpo, which becomes 
I, 
"a place name." The Arabic followed the 
pattern 
j 
of a hollow 
root, 
such 
as 
o,j9 suira, "picture." 
i 
sikka, "plough" 
or "plowshare," 
CKAI, "to plough 
or ploughing." 
The 
Coptic utterance 
developed 
to fit the 
Arabic 
pattern 
4 
of a double 
cain 
verb such as dJ libba, "seed or kernel." 
" 
sir, 
"salty," 
iPp, "brine." 
The 
change of x to , 
is common, such as 
WAAULT, 
which 
becomes 
a', 
"a place 
name." 
45

-J taff, "to spit," S Trq. The second 
Coptic consonant was doubled in Arabic 
to make a triliteral double 'ain root from 
which other parts of speech are derived 
such as tefdf, "spitting," and matfuf 
caleh, "spat upon." 
t takhkh, "to become drunk," A rTAe, 
"be drunken." The Arabic followed a 
regular double Cain verb. 
.-~ timsdh, "crocodile," SB TrACAQ , 
"the crocodile." Arabic borrowed the 
Coptic word with the feminine definite 
article re; thus the word fell into the 
pattern JlU 
such as 
J1c 
timthdl, 
"image." 6 
j. tit, "gather," used only in the 
expression fi,j- Lb Z tut ya hdSwi, "gather 
(for) the magic player," S ToowTe, "be 
gathered or collected." 
tabha, "prayer" (Sobhy), SABF 
rTWoe, "pray." The final a in Arabic is 
perhaps a sign of a feminine noun. 
. 
tdsh, "border" or "boundary," 
especially of a field, SAF TraU (Sobhy), 
"limit, boundary." There is no problem 
with this word because Coptic t is un- 
aspirated and its representation in Arabic 
as t is normal. 
.L 
taydb, "east wind," S TOFvI?eRT 
from TrH, "wind," and eC.1T, "east." 
It followed the Arabic JlJ pattern such 
as '.? 
sahdb, "clouds." 
44 
tohma, "invitation" (Sobhy), S 
.T(?,. 
"to invite." The Arabic pattern 
is M.; and Coptic i 
became Arabic 5 
instead of i because of the guttural h. 
..' tuba, "a brick," S Trw&^. This is a 
normal change, since Coptic o is usually 
borrowed in Arabic as u. The Arabic form 
with the article is the source of English 
(from Spanish) "adobe" < at-tuba. 
l:' 
turya, "axe," SA ropJ, "spade" or 
"pick." The word is normal except that it 
6 See W. F. Albright, The Vocalization of Egyptian 
Syllabic Orthography, p. 151, and T. O. Lambdin, 
"Another Cuneiform Transcription of Egyptian msh," 
JNES, 
XII (1953), pp. 284-85. 
received an added feminine ending in 
Arabic, possibly because it is feminine in 
Coptic. 
j.i 
'uini, "mill sound," B 
trij, 
"mill." The leveling of the Coptic diph- 
thong w to Arabic 'U is normal. 
'L-, wdhZa, "oasis," S ovapt with the 
same meaning. Regardless of the origin 
of this Coptic word Egyptian Arabic 4-l1 
wdha is most probably derived from it. It 
became so common in Egypt that classical 
Arabic included it in its vocabulary, as it 
did with lexical items of other languages 
with which it came in contact, e.g., 
(jc3 firdaws, "paradise," from Persian, 
and 
8i 
sijnun, "prison," from Latin. 
y-' 
wahwah, "to cry with pain, to 
bark," SB ovap&h2, "bark, growl." The 
phonetic changes are normal. 
QJ-I wdrshurr, "wood saw" (Sobhy), 
B 
Bagjo'p, 
"saw." Although 
)Jlj 
wdrshuir is related to minshdr in meaning 
it is difficult to trace it back to the root 
. 
nshr. Possibly 
&aJyo'p itself is a 
loanword in Coptic from Semitic (Hebrew 
iti), 
nevertheless it may be con- 
sidered as the origin of Egyptian Arabic 
wdrshur. However, the extra r in the latter 
is problematic, but it can be paralleled by 
other examples where internal doubled 
consonants are resolved into r, 1, or n + a 
single consonant. 
4.Jj weba, "a grain measure (two kelas 
or one-sixth of an 'ardab)," S orln, B 
oInTI, "measure of grain, less than an 
'ardab." It is apparent that the two words 
are related; the Arabic apparently was 
vocalized by analogy with 4 
J kla, "a 
grain measure one-twelfth of an 'ardab, 
considered the unit of grain measuring in 
Egypt." It may be noted here that a 
measure of grain ;n' 
'efah exists in 
Hebrew,7 and possibly in other Semitic 
7 See T. O. Lambdin, 
Egyptian 
Loanwords and 
Transcriptions 
in the Ancient 
Semitic 
Languages, 
pp. 13, 14.

languages, but these cannot be considered 
an origin for Egyptian 
Arabic L .. 
weba 
simply because the latter Arabic form does 
not exist anywhere outside Egypt. More- 
over, Hebrew 'efah is expected to become 
Arabic 
.! 'ifah and not ..J weba. 
J J wirwir, "fresh," used especially 
with fresh radishes such as J-' . 
J: 
wirwir ya fijl; SA tpp? or &Hpe, "young 
or fresh." The two consonants of Coptic 
were duplicated 
in Arabic to follow a 
quadriliteral 
pattern 
such 
as 
shibshib, "slippers." 
.jr zir, "large water pitcher," B cip, 
"jar." The change is normal. 
,,, zarta, "flatus ventris," S CaporATCe 
with the same meaning. The last sound of 
the Coptic word was left out in borrowing, 
and possibly the word became capoarT 
sarchat. The final 
T was considered in 
Arabic as ; (ta marbiuta) which is a sign of 
feminine in classical Arabic and which is 
usually left out in Egyptian Arabic, and 
the word became sarcha. The ch sound 
being a palatal stop, was changed to an 
alveolar stop t, thus rendering sarta. The 
s was voiced possibly owing to the Coptic 
feminine 
article 
T-r which preceded 
s 
causing the combination t + sar- to sound 
like an affricate ts which may be rendered 
as Arabic j;. A root zrt was formed from 
which other words were derived such as 
,3; zarrat (II Conjugation), 
"to blow 
wind." 
The above one hundred and nine valid 
loanwords 
were 
mostly 
taken 
into 
Egyptian 
Arabic according to standard 
Arabic patterns. 
In many cases Coptic 
supplied 
only the triliteral 
roots from 
which other Arabic words were derived. 
Coptic loanwords included items peculiar 
to 
Coptic 
worship 
such as Lj; 'anba, 
"bishop," 
and 
. 
Y'ajbiya, "book of 
prayer." They also include items that are 
used in remote villages not common to 
the main Egyptian 
population 
such as 
. 
hnayye, "a thing," and ,Uj 
raftdw, 
"a measure of grain." This leaves the 
number of Coptic loanwords used com- 
monly in Egyptian 
Arabic smaller still; 
they mainly 
include names 
of various 
kinds of fish, vulgarisms, 
and names of 
cooking utensils and foods not used in 
Arabia. 
It might be mentioned here that 
Turkish, which was never a vernacular of 
Egypt, left more lexical items in Egyptian 
Arabic than Coptic did. This is indicated 
by a partial survey of Turkish loanwords 
in Egyptian 
Arabic by E. Littmann,8 
which includes two hundred and sixty- 
four words. 
The limited 
influence 
of Coptic 
on 
Egyptian Arabic can only be explained as 
lack of widespread bilingualism in Egypt 
during 
the 
transition 
from 
Coptic 
to 
Arabic. This leads to the conclusion that 
the Copts who were converted to Islam at 
any one time must have been a minor 
segment of the population. Again9 it may 
be said that Egyptian Muslims today are 
right in claiming 
a predominant 
Arab 
ancestry.

How to make a Coptic sentence :  
A sentence requires a  subject  and a verb.  The subject that carries out the  
action can  be a noun or pronoun. 
(1) VERBS 
 
Verbs given here can  be  used  in  the  imperative  form,  that  is  to  make 
 a request or to give an order. 
 
hemci  sit            ( haemsi )                mosi        go - walk        ( moshi ) 
 
[i     take                    ( chi )                cwtem   listen            ( soataem ) 
 
ouwm  eat    ( ou - woam )                 cw            drink                 ( soa ) 
 
` sl/l  pray       ( eshleel )              `cmou       bless               ( esmou ) 
 
caji   speak           ( saji )                ws             read                ( oash ) 
 
ouwst kneel - worship ou-woasht     joust    look                ( gousht ) 
 
  
(2) NOUNS 
 
Nouns are used as  subjects or  objects. In Coptic,  nouns  are either masculine 
or  feminine. We shall  start  with  masculine nouns.  The  best  way to tell   the

(1)    SPECIAL DEFINITE ARTICLES 
We have  learned  the definite article   pi    is used for  singular  masculine nouns. 
In this unit,  two special definite masculine articles  are presented:   `p  and   `v. 
These are  frequently  used for sing.  masculine  nouns  of  particular importance 
in religious texts. 
 
` vi wt   the father     ( ef - yoat )            `vran   the name            ( ef - ran ) 
` vnou]  (the) God  (ef - nou - ti)            `vr/      the sun               ( ef - ree ) 
` vnobi    the sin           ( ef - novi )           `p/i         the house           ( ep - ee ) 
` p[oi c   the lord       ( ep - choys )            `pouro  the king       ( ep - ou - ro ) 
` ps/ri   the son       ( ep - sheeri )           `pkahi   the land       ( ep - ka - hi ) 
 
The student will be familiar  with  these  special  articles in the course of his or her 
study, and through attendance of church service.However,  many other “religious”  
words take the usual masculine article  pi .

(2)    DIRECT OBJECT 
An object is a noun or noun - equivalent,  governed  by a verb.  The indirect object,                     
as we learned, is separated from the verb by a preposition.  A direct object is  acted 
upon  by  transitive verb. In Coptic,  such object is  separated  from   the commonly  
used verbs by one of these articles              ` e     ` m    ` n  These 
articles are  called  ‘’  object signs  “.

(1)  THE FEMININE NOUNS 
 
] is the definite article for single feminine noun. There are two  special    definite 
articles ,   ~ t and    ` y.  ou   is  the  indefinite  article  for singular feminine 
nouns, as much as it is the indefinite article for single masculine nouns.

 (2)   PLURAL NOUNS 
The definite article for plural nouns is    NI  .   The indefinite article is  HAN, 
for both masculine and feminine plural nouns. 
Most Coptic nouns do not change in plural .  We understand the number  we are   
dealing with,  by  the  plural  articles used.

(3)  NOUNS USED WITHOUT ARTICLES 
 
A - Some rare nouns do not take articles  (definite  or indefinite) .      The typical  
example is  amen] ,  which means  hell   ( a-men-ti ). 
 
B -  Nouns  made  up  of  a verb  and  the  relative   pronoun    v/et, y/et  
 and n/et  do not usually take an article. 
v/et   who, whom    (fi-aet)            for    singular   masculine 
y/et      who, whom   (thi-aet)          for    singular     feminine 
n/et      who, whom   (ni-aet)           for plural of both genders 
 
                                                                     (15)

B - Continuous present tense     describes an action still happening. In Coptic 
it is also used  for special adjective construction based on  the past participle. 
  
ei caji      I am speaking                                                     (aey saji )

eucaji      they are speaking    (plural masc\fem)                (aev saji) 
 
RULES         
(1) Most Coptic verbs do not change in the various tenses i.e. the ends remain the 
same.  The changes are confined to the subject  pronouns. 
(2)The subject pronouns  ],  ` k,  te,  ` f, ` c, ten, teten and ce  for 
the simple present and, the  pronouns   ei , ek, ere, ef, ec, en, 
ereten and  eu for the present continuous, indicate the subject(s) who 
carries out the action. Unlike the case in English, there are other subject pronouns 
for    “ I, you, he, she,..etc, that are used independently.  These are : 
anok   I                      (anok)         ` nyok  you       (sing.masc)    (enthok) 
` nyo  you (sing.fem)    (entho)       ` nyof  he                                 (enthof) 
 
                                                                  (22)

` nyoc she                    (enthos)      anon   we                                 (anon) 
` nywten  you (plur) enthoataen      ` ` ` ` nywou they     (plural)     (enthoa-ou) 
 
 Examples          
  anok pe pi rwmi                        I am  the  man                   
  ` nyoc te ]seri  .                        She is the girl. 
  anon ne ni rem` n,/mi                We are the Egyptians 
 
(3) To negate a verb in the simple present  or  continuous  present  tense,  
  an  is  added    after  the  verb.      “an”  means  “not”. 
]caji  an      I  do not speak  .                                       (  ti-saji  an )

eucaji  an ` n]acpi  ` nrem` n,/mi       They are not speaking 
the  
 Coptic  language (aev-saji an en-ti-aspi en raem-en-keemi)   
 
(4) In English,  pronouns can not be used in  presence of  nouns.Thus, we say  
“the boy speaks”  or  “he speaks” but, can not say  “the boy he speaks”. In 
Coptic,  pronouns are usually added to the verb in the presence of  nouns.So we 
say   pi alou ` fcaji ,  ]seri  ~ ccaji   and    ni rwmi  cecaji         
There are however examples where pronouns are not used in the presence of  
nouns e.g.  ouoh pi kocmoc cwtem erwou "and the world listen to 
them".  Accordingly, we may say   pi alou caji  ,  ]seri  caji  ...etc

VERBS  OF  BEING,  LINK  VERBS  
NOFRI    nice .good. full of goodness 

--- Page 31 ---
( 1 ) The common verb “to be” is incomplete because it needs to be followed by a 
completing word, called a complement, e.g. The sky is blue. Here the “sky” is a 
subject, “is” is the link verb that requires completion, and  “blue” is a 
complement. 
A- Descriptive  verb  “to be” in Coptic: 
       pe “is” for sing. masculine       anok pe pi rwmi .     I   am   the   
man. 
       te “is” for sing. feminine        `nyoc te ]mau.     She is the  mother. 
      ne  “are”  for  plural             `nywou ne  ni ou/b They are the 
priests. 
 
When the complement has the indefinite article  ou or  han   the descrip.verb is 
 generally placed at the end of the sentence. 
 
anok ourwmi  pe.            I am a man                      (anok ou-roami pae) 
` nyoc oumau te           She is  a mother               (enthos ou-mav  tae) 
` nywou hanou/b ne    they are priests    (en-thoa-ou han-ouw-weeb nae) 
 
the descriptive  verb  to be in the past . 
 
ne ]vrw pe   It was winter.                                        (nae ti-ef-roa-pae) 
                        (30) 
 
 
Petroc ne ourwmi  ` nswi j pe   
Petros was a courageous man.                       ( petros nae ou-roami en shoayg pae)                                    
ne . . . . . . . .  pe =    WAS ,

ne ouon ouanz/b ` mnai  pe    
There was a school here.                                         (nae ou-on ou-anzeeb em-nay pae)  
ne ` mmon ` hli  ( pe)  ` mmau        
There was no body (there).                                        (nae em-mon eh-li  pae em-mav) 
 
 
B- Verb  “to be”  expressing  position  or  location ,  in  Coptic : 
 
ef,/ - efsop  is ( present, located), for sing. masc.   (aef-kee - aef-shop) 
ec,/ - ecsop     is (present, located), for sing. fem.    (aes-kee - aes-shop) 
eu,/ - eusop  are (present, located),  for plural        (aev-kee - aev-shop) 
 
* `f,/, ` c,/, ce,/ and    ` fsop,  ` csop,  cesop    can also be  
used,   
 but  not  as  often. 
 pi rwmi  ef,/ ( efsop)  qen pi /i .             The   man  is  in  the 
house. 
]ek` kl/ci a ec,/ ( ecsop)  qen }mi ` nhour The church is 
(present-situated) in Damanhour.        ti-aek-liciy-ya aes-kee\(aes-hop) khaen timi-
en-hoor 
  
                                                                            (31)

ni jwm eu,/ ( eusop)  hi je n  ] vorsi .    The books are on the 
table. 
pi keleui n ` f,/ qa ` ynouni  ` nni ss/ The axe is at the root of 
the trees. 
 (pi-kaelaevin  efkee  kha eth-nouni en-ni-esh-sheen) 
 
The  past tense of   ef,/ , ec,/ and eu,/ is  naf,/ , nac,/ and 
nau,/, meaning WAS and  WERE   (present, located). The same applies for  
efsop, ecsop and eusop, the past form of which is  nafsop,  
nacsop  and   nausop.  
It should be noted that the past form of  verb to be  expressing position can to be 
followed by   pe  ,  as  noted in the past tense of the descriptive verb ‘to be’. 
 
pi alou naf,/f ` mmau pe .                                       The  boy  was  
there. 
]ekkl/ci a nac,/ qen ` ym/] ` n]baki  pe.  The church was 
in the middle of the city .              (ti-aek-lee-siy-ya nas-kee khaen aeth- meeti en ti-
vaki pae)                   
 
( 2 ) Other  link  verbs   are:  to seem   and  to  become. These are sometimes 
called verbs of being, because verbs of this kind have the same basic meaning as 
the verb  to  be.  Furthermore, and like verb to be, they must have an object to 
make sense. It is not possible to say  “ He  became ” without completing the 
sentense.               
` couwnh ( je)  ` fjerjer ` nteni c                 It seems (that) he 
plays tennis. 
` couwnh ( je)  ` cka] an ` n]metrem` n,/mi .   It seems (that) 
she does not understand Coptic.   ( es-ou-woanh  jae  es-kati  an en-ti-maet - raem - en

Pronunciation of the letter     
     This letter is common in both Coptic words as well as in 
words of Greek origin. 
     In any Coptic word, it is pronounced  K.    
     In words of Greek origin: The original pronunciation in 
the Greek language is not K but it is different from any sound 
in the Coptic language and it is somewhat between SH and 
KH, depending on its position in the word.  
     It is pronounced closer to the SH in words where this 
letter is followed by 
 , 

,

, or 

. and pronounced closer to 
KH in other situations. Therefore the Copts adopted an 
approximate rule to pronounce it SH in words where the 
letter is followed by 

, 

,

, or 

 and KH in other situations. 
     However, traditionally, this rule was never 
followed all the time, and in many words of Greek origin,  
 is traditionally pronounced K.    Such words include  
DQ]QH@ pronounced er-ekriya   not   er-ekhriya, 
]QVL pronounced ekrom   not   ekhrom
J@SHNTLDM pronounced katikomeni not katikhomeni,  
]QNMNB pronounced ekronos  not   ekhronos,
DL@KVBH@ pronounced ekmalosiya  not   ekhmalosiya
]QL@ pronounced ekreema  not    ekhreema
	
pronounced psikee  not   psishee,  
and DT pronounced evkee  not  evshee   specially since 
evshee sounds very similar to the Coptic word  DARH evshi  
which means slumber and sleepiness, and confuse the listener 
whether you mean prayer or sleepiness.

Notes 
1. The Coptic language is described by 
Professor 
Rodolphe 
Kasser 
of 
the 
University of Geneva, Switzerland as 
"one of the most beautiful, 
most cleverly structured and 
most musical in the world" * 
 
2. These lessons are designed to teach 
some introductory basic principles of the 
"Bohairic" Coptic Dialect which is used 
by the church in its liturgical services. 
 
3. The pronunciation is the traditional 
pronunciation that is used by the Church 
as well as the few families who use 
Coptic as their daily language. 
 
4. There are 32 letters in the Coptic 
alphabet. The first 25 are derived from the 
Greek letters that have their origin in the 
Egyptian Hieroglyphic script, the last 7 
letters are directly derived from the 
Egyptian Demotic Script.

The Egyptian Alphabets; 
Their relationship to other alphabets 
Adeeb B. Makar, Ph.D. 
 
Egyptian Contributions to the development of civilization: 
       The contributions to civilization made by Egypt are best 
described by Dr. Leonard H. Lesko who wrote1: "The ancient 
Egyptians made outstanding contributions to the development of 
civilization.  They created the world's first national government, 
basic forms of arithmetic, and a 365-day calendar.   They invented 
a form of picture writing called Hieroglyphics. They also invented 
papyrus, a paperlike writing material made from the stems of 
papyrus plants.  The Egyptians developed one of the first religions 
to emphasize life after death. They built great cities in which many 
skilled architects, doctors, engineers, painters, and sculptors 
worked.  The best known achievements of ancient Egypt, however, 
are the pyramids they built as tombs for their rulers.  The most 
famous pyramids stand at Giza. These gigantic stone structures - 
marvels of architecture and engineering skills - have been 
preserved by the dry climate for about 4500 years. They serve as 
spectacular reminders of the glory of ancient Egypt."     
       The rapid development of their writing system was facilitated 
by their discovery of methods to make paper and ink.  Walter A. 
Fairservis, Jr.2 states that "One of the most important contributions 
made by ancient Egypt was papermaking. Paper was made from the 
papyrus plant that grows abundantly in the marches of the Nile 
Valley.   Before the Egyptians invented paper, writing was done on 
clay tablets, which crumble, or on stone, which is heavy and hard to 
carve. Unlike the rest of the ancient world, the Egyptians required 
only a brush and some ink, and they could easily carry these 
materials anywhere they went."  Donald Jackson also affirms3 that 
"Indeed the marriage of liquid ink, pen and paper first brought 
about by the Egyptians was such a revolutionary step that it is still 
the fundamental basis of most handwritten communication today." 
 
 
Egyptian Alphabets as the Ultimate Source of the Modern 
Western Alphabet: 
       The Egyptians developed the Hieroglyphic Writing around 3000 
BC4. It consisted originally of signs that stood for words or ideas, 
but gradually each sign stood for a syllable or a sound. Hieratic, 
which is a simplified cursive form of the hieroglyphic, was soon 
developed by Egyptian scribes who used it for both religious and 
nonreligious purposes5. Around 700 BC Demotic writing was 
developed. This was simpler and faster to write than the hieratic. 
The scribes used it for correspondence and record keeping5.   
        Around 1500 BC, the Semites developed an alphabet which is 
based on the Egyptian hieroglyphic system4,6,7. The Phoenicians, 
one of the Semitic peoples perfected an alphabet around 1000 BC. 
The Greek alphabet, which is the progenitor of Roman (Latin) 
letters4,6 was directly derived from the Phoenician alphabet4,6,7,8, 
The Greeks not only took the forms of letters, they also took over 
some Phoenician names for the letters. The first letter of the 
Phoenician alphabet,  , its name is aleph, meaning ox, became 
, 
or alpha in Greek. The second letter, 
, or beth, meaning house, 
became 
, or beta in Greek4.   
       Based on the above-mentioned facts, the English alphabet of 
today can be traced back to the sign writing of ancient Egypt. 
Barbara Mertz states that: "The birds and the bees of the ancient 
Egyptian script may have a more direct relationship to our own 
alphabet than we realize9". Davies10 cites a quote by Gardiner 
describing this observation: "The hieroglyphs lives on though in 
transmuted 
form 
within 
our 
own 
alphabet". 
Compton's 
Encyclopedia6 states that: "The Latin Alphabet is a development 
from the Greek alphabet.  The Greek alphabet, in turn, is an 
adaptation of a writing system which was developed among the 
Semites of Syria about 1500 BC. Outwardly, this first Semite 
writing seems to be an original and individual creation.. Its 
principals however, are certainly based on the Egyptian word-
syllabic writing". Marianne Cooley4 states that "The English 
alphabet   developed   from  a  number  of  early  writing  systems,  
 
 
        i                                                     ii

beginning with the sign writing of Ancient Egypt". In the same 
reference4, she shows, in a table form,  the  development  of  each  
letter  starting  with  the  Egyptian  (about 3000 BC) followed by 
Semitic (1500 BC) followed by Phoenician (about 1000 BC) 
followed by Greek (about 600 BC) followed by Roman (114 AD) 
and finally the modern alphabet. Paul Johnson, in his book The 
Civilization of Ancient Egypt11, succinctly summarizes the 
development of modern Western Alphabet from the ancient 
Egyptian Alphabet in the following: "The Egyptians mined at this 
Sinai site (the ancient turquoise mines) both during the Middle 
Kingdom and the New Kingdom.   During the reign of Ammenemes 
III, around 1800 BC, Semitic workers were used at this site.  One of 
them, evidently a man of creative ingenuity, became familiar with 
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and determined to adapt it to his 
native Canaanite language, then unwritten.  His stroke of genius 
was to select the alphabetic signs from the hieroglyphs, rejecting 
the consonantal groups and the ideograms. The new script survived 
and gradually spread north through Palestine and Syria, acquiring 
cursive characteristics in the process. In northern Syria, near the 
ancient port of Ras Shamra, it took on a cuneiform style - that is, it 
was adapted to the writing materials of the area, tablets and stylus. 
This Ras Shamra script, ancient Ugaritic, has no other connection 
with Sumerian or Babylonian cuneiform.  It is merely a modified 
form of the Canaanite-Egyptian alphabetic script.  It was gradually 
adopted by the entire region, in various forms, and above all by the 
Phoenicians, who had an alphabet of twenty-eight letters.  In the 
ninth century BC, the Greeks took over the Phoenician alphabet 
more or less as they found it, retaining even the names of the letters.  
They reversed the direction of the script from right-to-left to left-to-
right, but the really important change they introduced, made 
essential by the structure of their own non-semitic tongue, was the 
vowel-sign.  They switched the signs for six Canaanite consonants 
not used in Greek to vowels, and thus gave the world the structure 
of the alphabet more or less as we have it today.  The ultimate 
source of the Western alphabet, therefore, is ancient Egypt"11.  
 
 
       The Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia12 traces back the origin 
of several English letters to their hieroglyphic origin. For example, 
the letter "A" is traced back to the Egyptian hieroglyph of an eagle, 
the letter "B" from the hieroglyph for "crane", etc. 
 
The Development of the Coptic Alphabet: 
A. The origin of the word "Coptic": 
       The words "Copt, Coptic" as well as the words "Egypt, 
Egyptian" have the same origin; and that is the old Egyptian words 
describing Egypt as "E-KA-Ptah" meaning the House of the Spirit 
of Ptah. ( E means House; Ka means Spirit; and Ptah is one of the 
famous Gods of Old Egypt).  Therefore, the words "Coptic" and 
"Egyptian" are linguistically one and the same word. 
 
B. The origin of the Coptic Alphabet: 
       The present 32 letters of the Coptic Alphabet are derived from 
two sources; The first 25 letters are modified from the Greek 
alphabet (table 1); it should be remembered that the origin of these 
Greek letters can be traced back to the old Egyptian letters4.   
whereas the last 7 letters are a modification from Demotic letters 
(table 2)13.  
 
C. The contribution of the Coptic Alphabet to the Russian 
Alphabets: 
       The current Alphabet of the Russian Language is known as the 
Cyrillic Alphabet. It was invented by Saint Cyril (826 - 869 AD) 
and Saint Methodius (815 - 884 AD), two Greek brothers who were 
missionaries to Russia during the 9th Century. They knew Coptic 
and they introduced, along with the Greek letters, Coptic letters 
such as R (written as Υ) into the Russian Alphabet that is still in use 
in Russia today 14 .  
 
D. The Greek words in the Coptic Liturgy and the Coptic 
Language in general: 
       In the first few centuries of Christianity in Egypt, the Greek 
language was the cultural language of the world, in much the same

way as the English language these days. Greek was always the 
language used in international councils (Ecumenical councils).  
Many of the Coptic Church fathers e.g. Saint Athanasius, our 20th 
Pope,  wrote mainly in Greek because, at that time, this is how 
people everywhere in the world would understand.  However, many 
other Church fathers wrote in Coptic.  Many Egyptians, especially 
in Alexandria, spoke Greek very fluently, in addition to Egyptian 
(Coptic) their mother tongue.  
       When Saint Mark came to Egypt and started his ministry there, 
Greek was the language that Saint Mark used and it was the 
language of the Liturgy that He handed down to his successors. 
When the Liturgy was later translated from Greek to Egyptian 
(Coptic), the Church kept some Greek words and expressions, and 
the Copts were very familiar with the meaning of these words.  
However, it is very important to remember that over 90% of the 
Liturgical service ∑ ℑ  Ζ ηΖ←≡ Ζ and the praises ♥ ⁄±∞ Ζ 
is in Egyptian (Coptic), and less than 10% is in Greek. 
 
 The following are few examples of words of Greek origin that are 
used in our Liturgy: 
 
1. Words of Greek origin that are used by the Coptic Church and 
many other churches.  Actually these words are now part of many 
languages, including the Coptic as well as the English language:

  It should be remembered that the Coptic Language represents the 
final development of the Egyptian language.  Cyrus Gordon, in his 
book, "Forgotten Scripts", states that: "The Coptic Church still 
preserves the native Egyptian language written in Greek characters, 
so that we have an unbroken tradition of Egyptian texts spanning 
about five thousand years"15.  As a matter of fact, the Coptic 
language was the real key to the deciphering of the hieroglyphic and 
Demotic scripts by Champollion16, 17.  As a French teenager living 
in Grenoble, France, Champollion dreamed

of being the one who would unlock the secrets of the Rosetta stone.  
He studied both ancient History and Coptic language.   Christine 
Hobson in her book "The World of the Pharaohs" 18 describes 
Champollion as "A genius with a gift of languages, including Coptic 
which he mastered early, believing correctly, that it would be the 
key he would need one day to understand Egyptian".   Later on, he 
used his knowledge of the Coptic language to decipher the 
hieroglyphic writings on Rosetta stone.   This great accomplishment 
of Champollion widely opened the doors to the unlocking of the 
glorious mysteries of Pharaonic Egypt15, 16, 17. 
  
The importance of the Egyptian (Coptic) language. 
1. It represents the final stage of the development of the Egyptian 
tongue, and in the words of Cyrus Gordon15, we have "an unbroken 
tradition of Egyptian texts spanning about 5000 years". Coptic 
language was the spoken language in Egypt until the 11th Century 
when it was gradually replaced by Arabic.  There are some 
historical records indicating that it was still the spoken language in 
some areas of Upper Egypt until the 17th  century 19. 
2. It was the language that Jesus - as a baby visiting Egypt with 
Saint Mary and Saint Joseph - heard and spoke.   Egypt was the 
only country Jesus visited outside his home country.  Therefore, we 
feel that our old country and our language were blessed through this 
visit. 
3. Although the Coptic language, at the present time, is no longer 
used by significant number of Egyptians, it still lives on in the 
hundreds of words in the Egyptian Arabic dialect spoken everyday 
in Egypt 20. 
4. The Bible was translated to the Coptic language around the 
second century by the Egyptian scholars of the theological School 
of Alexandria, (Pantenus and his disciples)21 , who were very fluent 
in both Greek and Coptic.   Therefore the Coptic translation is 
considered one of the most reliable and accurate translations 
available. 
5. The original writings of several early Church fathers were in 
Coptic, e.g. the writings and teachings of Saint Antony, the first 
Christian monk in the world, and those of Saint Shenouda the 
archmandrite were all in the Coptic language21.

Notes 
 
 
1. The Coptic language is described by Professor Rodolphe Kasser 
of the University of Geneva, Switzerland as "one of the most 
beautiful, most cleverly structured and most 
musical in the world" * 
 
2. These lessons are designed to teach some introductory basic 
principles of the "Bohairic" Coptic Dialect which is used by the church 
in its liturgical services. 
 
3. The pronunciation is the traditional pronunciation that is used by 
the Church as well as the few families who use Coptic as their daily 
language. 
 
4. There are 32 letters in the Coptic alphabet. The first 25 are derived 
from the Greek letters that have their origin in the Egyptian 
Hieroglyphic script, the last 7 letters are directly derived from the 
Egyptian Demotic Script.

LECTURE # 1  
 
The Egyptian Alphabets; 
Their relationship to other alphabets 
 
Egyptian Contributions to the development of civilization: 
 
       The contributions to civilization made by Egypt are best described by 
Dr. Leonard H. Lesko who wrote1: "The ancient Egyptians made 
outstanding contributions to the development of civilization.  They created 
the world's first national government, basic forms of arithmetic, and a 365-
day calendar.   They invented a form of picture writing called Hieroglyphics. 
They also invented papyrus, a paperlike writing material made from the 
stems of papyrus plants.  The Egyptians developed one of the first religions 
to emphasize life after death. They built great cities in which many skilled 
architects, doctors, engineers, painters, and sculptors worked.  The best 
known achievements of ancient Egypt, however, are the pyramids they built 
as tombs for their rulers.  The most famous pyramids stand at Giza. These 
gigantic stone structures - marvels of architecture and engineering skills - 
have been preserved by the dry climate for about 4500 years. They serve 
as spectacular reminders of the glory of ancient Egypt."     
 
       The rapid development of their writing system was facilitated by their 
discovery of methods to make paper and ink.  Walter A. Fairservis, Jr.2 
states that "One of the most important contributions made by ancient Egypt 
was papermaking. Paper was made from the papyrus plant that grows 
abundantly in the marches of the Nile Valley.   Before the Egyptians 
invented paper, writing was done on clay tablets, which crumble, or on 
stone, which is heavy and hard to carve. Unlike the rest of the ancient 
world, the Egyptians required only a brush and some ink, and they could 
easily carry these materials anywhere they went."  Donald Jackson also 
affirms3 that "Indeed the marriage of liquid ink, pen and paper first brought 
about by the Egyptians was such a revolutionary step that it is still the 
fundamental basis of most handwritten communication today." 
 
Egyptian Alphabets as the Ultimate Source of the Modern Western 
Alphabet: 
        
The Egyptians developed the Hieroglyphic Writing around 3000 BC4. 
It consisted originally of signs that stood for words or ideas, but gradually 
each sign stood for a syllable or a sound. Hieratic, which is a simplified 
cursive form of the hieroglyphic, was soon developed by Egyptian scribes 
who used it for both religious and nonreligious purposes5. Around 700 BC 

--- Page 4 ---
Demotic writing was developed. This was simpler and faster to write than 
the hieratic. The scribes used it for correspondence and record keeping5.   
 
        Around 1500 BC, the Semites developed an alphabet which is based 
on the Egyptian hieroglyphic system4,6,7. The Phoenicians, one of the 
Semitic peoples perfected an alphabet around 1000 BC. The Greek 
alphabet, which is the progenitor of Roman (Latin) letters4,6 was directly 
derived from the Phoenician alphabet4,6,7,8, The Greeks not only took the 
forms of letters, they also took over some Phoenician names for the letters. 
The first letter of the Phoenician alphabet,  , its name is aleph, meaning 
ox, became , or alpha in Greek. The second letter, , or beth, meaning 
house, became , or beta in Greek4.   
 
       Based on the above-mentioned facts, the English alphabet of today 
can be traced back to the sign writing of ancient Egypt. Barbara Mertz 
states that: "The birds and the bees of the ancient Egyptian script may 
have a more direct relationship to our own alphabet than we realize9". 
Davies10 cites a quote by Gardiner describing this observation: "The 
hieroglyphs lives on though in transmuted form within our own alphabet". 
Compton's Encyclopedia6 states that: "The Latin Alphabet is a development 
from the Greek alphabet.  The Greek alphabet, in turn, is an adaptation of a 
writing system which was developed among the Semites of Syria about 
1500 BC. Outwardly, this first Semite writing seems to be an original and 
individual creation.. Its principals however, are certainly based on the 
Egyptian word-syllabic writing". Marianne Cooley4 states that "The English 
alphabet   developed   from  a  number  of  early  writing  systems, 
beginning with the sign writing of Ancient Egypt". In the same reference4, 
she shows, in a table form,  the  development  of  each  letter  starting  with  
the  Egyptian  (about 3000 BC) followed by Semitic (1500 BC) followed by 
Phoenician (about 1000 BC) followed by Greek (about 600 BC) followed by 
Roman (114 AD) and finally the modern alphabet. Paul Johnson, in his 
book The Civilization of Ancient Egypt11, succinctly summarizes the 
development of modern Western Alphabet from the ancient Egyptian 
Alphabet in the following: "The Egyptians mined at this Sinai site (the 
ancient turquoise mines) both during the Middle Kingdom and the New 
Kingdom.   During the reign of Ammenemes III, around 1800 BC, Semitic 
workers were used at this site.  One of them, evidently a man of creative 
ingenuity, became familiar with Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and 
determined to adapt it to his native Canaanite language, then unwritten.  
His stroke of genius was to select the alphabetic signs from the 
hieroglyphs, rejecting the consonantal groups and the ideograms. The new 
script survived and gradually spread north through Palestine and Syria, 
acquiring cursive characteristics in the process. In northern Syria, near the 
ancient port of Ras Shamra, it took on a cuneiform style - that is, it was 
adapted to the writing materials of the area, tablets and stylus. This Ras 

--- Page 5 ---
Shamra script, ancient Ugaritic, has no other connection with Sumerian or 
Babylonian cuneiform.  It is merely a modified form of the Canaanite-
Egyptian alphabetic script.  It was gradually adopted by the entire region, in 
various forms, and above all by the Phoenicians, who had an alphabet of 
twenty-eight letters.  In the ninth century BC, the Greeks took over the 
Phoenician alphabet more or less as they found it, retaining even the 
names of the letters.  They reversed the direction of the script from right-to-
left to left-to-right, but the really important change they introduced, made 
essential by the structure of their own non-semitic tongue, was the vowel-
sign.  They switched the signs for six Canaanite consonants not used in 
Greek to vowels, and thus gave the world the structure of the alphabet 
more or less as we have it today.  The ultimate source of the Western 
alphabet, therefore, is ancient Egypt"11.  
 
The Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia12 traces back the origin of several 
English letters to their hieroglyphic origin. For example, the letter "A" is 
traced back to the Egyptian hieroglyph of an eagle, the letter "B" from the 
hieroglyph for "crane", etc. 
 
The Development of the Coptic Alphabet: 
 
A. The origin of the word "Coptic": 
       The words "Copt, Coptic" as well as the words "Egypt, Egyptian" have 
the same origin; and that is the old Egyptian words describing Egypt as "E-
KA-Ptah" meaning the House of the Spirit of Ptah. ( E means House; Ka 
means Spirit; and Ptah is one of the famous Gods of Old Egypt).  
Therefore, the words "Coptic" and "Egyptian" are linguistically one and the 
same word. 
 
B. The origin of the Coptic Alphabet: 
       The present 32 letters of the Coptic Alphabet are derived from two 
sources; The first 25 letters are modified from the Greek alphabet (table 1); 
it should be remembered that the origin of these Greek letters can be 
traced back to the old Egyptian letters4.    whereas the last 7 letters are a 
modification from Demotic letters (table 2)13.  
 
C. The contribution of the Coptic Alphabet to the Russian Alphabets: 
       The current Alphabet of the Russian Language is known as the Cyrillic 
Alphabet. It was invented by Saint Cyril (826 - 869 AD) and Saint 
Methodius (815 - 884 AD), two Greek brothers who were missionaries to 
Russia during the 9th Century. They knew Coptic and they introduced, 
along with the Greek letters, Coptic letters such as  (written as 
) into the 
Russian Alphabet that is still in use in Russia today 14 .  
 
D. The Greek words in the Coptic Liturgy and the Coptic Language in 
general: 

--- Page 6 ---
       In the first few centuries of Christianity in Egypt, the Greek language 
was the cultural language of the world, in much the same way as the 
English language these days. Greek was always the language used in 
international councils (Ecumenical councils).  Many of the Coptic Church 
fathers e.g. Saint Athanasius, our 20th Pope, wrote mainly in Greek 
because, at that time, this is how people everywhere in the world would 
understand.  However, many other Church fathers wrote in Coptic.  Many 
Egyptians, especially in Alexandria, spoke Greek very fluently, in addition 
to Egyptian (Coptic) their mother tongue.  
 
       When Saint Mark came to Egypt and started his ministry there, Greek 
was the language that Saint Mark used and it was the language of the 
Liturgy that He handed down to his successors. When the Liturgy was later 
translated from Greek to Egyptian (Coptic), the Church kept some Greek 
words and expressions, and the Copts were very familiar with the meaning 
of these words.  However, it is very important to remember that over 90% 
of the Divine Liturgy service and the Praises 
 is in Egyptian (Coptic), 
and less than 10% is in Greek. 
 
 
The following are few examples of words of Greek origin that are 
used in our Liturgy: 
 
1. Words of Greek origin that are used by the Coptic Church and many 
other churches.  Actually these words are now part of many languages, 
including the Coptic as well as the English language:

It should be remembered that the Coptic Language represents the 
final development of the Egyptian language.  Cyrus Gordon, in his book, 
"Forgotten Scripts", states that: "The Coptic Church still preserves the 
native Egyptian language written in Greek characters, so that we have an 
unbroken tradition of Egyptian texts spanning about five thousand years"15.  
As a matter of fact, the Coptic language was the real key to the deciphering 
of the hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts by Champollion16, 17.  As a French 
teenager living in Grenoble, France, Champollion dreamed of being the one 
who would unlock the secrets of the Rosetta stone.  He studied both 
ancient History and Coptic language.   Christine Hobson in her book "The 
World of the Pharaohs" 18 describes Champollion as "A genius with a gift of 
languages, including Coptic which he mastered early, believing correctly, 
that it would be the key he would need one day to understand Egyptian".   
Later on, he used his knowledge of the Coptic language to decipher the 
hieroglyphic writings on Rosetta stone.   This great accomplishment of 
Champollion widely opened the doors to the unlocking of the glorious 
mysteries of Pharaonic Egypt15, 16, 17. 
 
 
The importance of the Egyptian (Coptic) language.

1. It represents the final stage of the development of the Egyptian tongue, 
and in the words of Cyrus Gordon15, we have "an unbroken tradition of 
Egyptian texts spanning about 5000 years". Coptic language was the 
spoken language in Egypt until the 11th Century when it was gradually 
replaced by Arabic.  There are some historical records indicating that it was 
still the spoken language in some areas of Upper Egypt until the 17th  
century 19. 
2. It was the language that Jesus - as a baby visiting Egypt with Saint Mary 
and Saint Joseph - heard and spoke.   Egypt was the only country Jesus 
visited outside his home country.  Therefore, we feel that our old country 
and our language were blessed through this visit. 
3. Although the Coptic language, at the present time, is no longer used by 
significant number of Egyptians, it still lives on in the hundreds of words in 
the Egyptian Arabic dialect spoken everyday in Egypt 20. 
4. The Bible was translated to the Coptic language around the second 
century by the Egyptian scholars of the theological School of Alexandria, 
who were very fluent in both Greek and Coptic.   Therefore the Coptic 
translation is considered one of the most reliable and accurate translations 
available. 
5. The original writings of several early Church fathers were in Coptic, e.g. 
the writings and teachings of Saint Antony, the first Christian monk in the 
world, and those of Saint Shenouda the archmandrite were all in the Coptic 
language21.

Introduction
       The student wishing to acquire a knowledge of Coptic, the last stage of the Old Egyptian Language, has 
had perforce to consult the Grammars of Stern, Steindorff, Mallon, Till and Chane, none of which are 
available in an English translation, and all of which are difficult to procure. The last Coptic Grammar of 
importance printed in English was the second edition of Dr Tattern's Grammar, published as long ago as 
1863 (online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/marcion/files/rc3/marcion_rc3-win32.zip/download; unzip, 
then run marcion.exe). Since that time our knowledge of the language has been greatly increased by the 
work of two generations of Coptic scholars. On the other hand, there now exists in English the magnificent 
Coptic Dictionary compiled by the late Dr W.E. Crum (www.metalog.org/files/crum.html). It is with some 
trepidation that I have ventured to write a new Grammar. The need for a work in English is pressing, but it 
must not be thought that this attempt to supply the need is in the nature of an exhaustive study. Such an 
attempt cannot yet be undertaken until a thorough systematic and statistical examination of the writings of 
Shenoute, the sole outstanding native writer of Coptic, has been made.
       The Sahidic dialect has been chosen, not because of any theory about its age, but for the very practical 
reason that it is the dialect which holds pride of place in Crum's dictionary. In addition to this fact, there 
exists a variety of texts in this dialect for the student to read. The examples, all of which are actual quota-
tions from texts, have been drawn for the most part from the Bible. Zoega's great Catalogus Codd. Coptico-
rum &c., 1810 (hereafter Z) has been utilized to a lesser degree. I have purposely limited myself to quoting 
a few examples in full, rather than giving many references to published texts which few students ever look 
up. The need for strict economy in space has compelled me to deal sketchily with Dr H.J. Polotsky's great 
discovery of the function of the Second Tenses (§186a), but students must not fail to read his study for 
themselves (Études de Syntaxe Copte, Cairo, 1944).
       The most pleasant part of my task remains. It is to express my thanks to those who have made my 
work possible. First, I have to thank Prof Jaroslav Cerny, of the University College, London, with whom I 
began my Coptic Studies. His kindness and help have been unfailing, and my debt to him is immeasurable. 
To Prof S.R.K. Glanville, of Cambridge, I am equally indebted. It was at his suggestion, and with his 
encouragement, that I began to compile this Grammar, and I have had the benefit of his advice at all times. 
Prof Battiscombe Gunn discussed several points of grammar with me on two occasions when I enjoyed his 
hospitality at Oxford, and I need hardly add that the result of these discussions has been the improvement 
of the work generally. Finally, I have to thank my wife, who not only read through the whole manuscript and 
made several valuable suggestions, but also by her thoughtfulness and management of a very busy 
household, has made the labour of writing this book infinitely easier than I had dared to hope.

Chapter I. The Alphabet.
§1. The Coptic Alphabet consists of 31 letters. Of these 24 were borrowed from the Greek Alphabet, the 
remainder being formed from Demotic characters to express consonantal sounds not represented in Greek.

Notes on the letters.
§2. g,  d, z appear but rarely in purely Coptic words, though they are commonly used in Greek loan words. 
However, it should be noted that there is a tendency for these letters to be replaced by other consonants; g 
replaced by k: e.g. akwra, ke6enna, knwmh; g replaced by 2: e.g. a2wn, sinarpa2h, 2nwmh; d replaced 
by t: e.g. skantalon, peths, preta (Latin praeda). Note: g occasionally appears for k when it follows n. 
This is especially common in the construct form ang– from anok ‘I’, and in the verbal prefix ng (for nk). In a 
few cases g appears for the k of the 2nd masc sing suffix when attached to a verbal form ending in n, e.g. 
souwn.g for souwn.k, tntwn.g for tntwn.k. A few verbal stems show the same tendency, e.g. moung for 
mounk , pwng for pwnk. z appears in an alternate spelling for anshbe ‘School’ as anzhbe.
§3. q, c, f, x, y occur mostly in Greek words. In Sahidic they are used sometimes as abbreviations for t6, 
ks, p6, k6, ps. They are used most extensively in the Bohairic dialect. The following may be noted: qe for 
t.6e ‘The manner’, and certain causative verbs, such as q.mko for t6.mko ‘To afflict’, q.mso for t.6mso ‘To 
cause to sit’. Also, cour for ksour ‘Ring’, lc (construct of lwks) ‘To bite’, sxat for sk6at ‘Marriage gift’, 
yis for psis ‘Nine’, leye for lepse ‘Fragment’.
§4. i and u are semi-consonants, for they are employed in Coptic both as consonants and as vowels. (a) As 
consonants: i usually appears in the form ei (less commonly as i+, which is the usual form in Bohairic), at the 
beginning of a syllable. At the end of a word the form i+ is usual. As a consonant it is equivalent to y in the 
English ‘Yet’ (cf Heb y); e.g. eiwt (yot) ‘Father’, eiwm (yom) ‘Sea’. u, except in Greek words, always appears 
in the form ou. As a consonant it is equivalent to a ‘W’ or ‘Y’ (cf Heb w); e.g. ouwm (wom) ‘To eat’, touwt 
(twot) ‘Idol’. (b) As vowels: i = i (as in litre); e.g. mise (mi-se) ‘To give birth to’, rir (rir) ‘Pig’. ou = u (as in 
‘Truth’); e.g. nanou.3 (na-nuf) ‘He is good’, mou6 (muh) ‘To be full’.
§5. The seven letters derived from Demotic:
(a) 4 = ‘sh’; transcribed in Greek as σζ or simply as σ. This letter also represents in some words an original 
h (curved underline); e.g. 4wpe (sho-pe) from Old Egyptian hpr. (b) 3 = ‘f’; e.g. sa3 (saf) ‘Yesterday’, 3i (fi) 
4

--- Page 5 ---
‘To carry’. It frequently replaces b; e.g. nou3 for noub ‘Gold’, 4w3 for 4wb ‘To shave’; and vice versa, 6o3 
‘Serpent’ plural 6boui. (c) 1 = ‘kh’ (Bohairic only; the ‘hard ch’ as in German and Scotch, or the ‘j’ of Spanish) is not 
used in Sahidic; in Bohairic, it corresponds to the Sahidic 6 when representing the old consonants h (curved 
underline) and h (Old Coptic form: www.metalog.org/files/plumley/plum-004.gif). (d) 6 = ‘h’; in Sahidic this letter 
represents four originally distinct sounds, transliterated from the hieroglyphic script as h, h (dotted), h (curved 
underline), and h. The wide field from which words containing this single form of four original sounds were 
drawn, can be seen in that about one ninth part of Crum's Coptic Dictionary is devoted to words beginning 
with 6! In Greek words, 6 is used to represent the Spiritus asper.; e.g. 6agios, 6hgemwn, 6olws, 6wste, 
etc. Also wrongly used in certain common words: e.g. 6eqnos, 6elpis, 6isos, 6ikwn (εικων). 8 is used 
only in Achmimic to represent the hieroglyphic h (curved underline) and h. It corresponds to Bohairic 1 and 
sometimes to Sahidic and Bohairic 4.
(e) ` is transcribed in Greek as τζ or τς (Cf Heb. c). Sometimes it stands as a contraction for t4; e.g. `po for 
t 4po
.
 ‘To cause to become, to beget’. For convenience in reading it may be pronounced in English as the ‘J’ 
in ‘Joke’ or ‘Jam’. Note: ` frequently alternates with 2, especially in Bohairic; e.g. Sah 2i` Boh `i` ‘Hand’, 
`wlk/2wlk ‘To stretch’, `ero/2ero ‘To blaze’, no2/no` ‘Great’.
(f) 2 = a hard ‘g’. The original Demotic sign represented k. In Coptic 2 often replaces k; e.g. lw`k and 
lw`2 ‘To stick’. Also, as noted above (e), 2 alternates with `.
(g) 5 = ‘t’. It should also be noted that although this letter is counted as a separate symbol in the 
Alphabetical table, words beginning with 5 should be consulted in Crum's Coptic Dictionary under t.
§6. The Old Egyptian language represented in writing two consonants which were not written in Coptic. 
These were the glottal stop 3 (Aleph) and the guttural ‘ (Ayin): (a) 3 at an early period had begun to 
alternate with ’i (y), and as a result the old consonant is represented in many Coptic words as ei (i+); e.g. 
eiw6e ‘Field’ (old 3ht [dotted h]). But in other forms 3 has completely vanished; e.g. kwb ‘To double’ (old 
k3b). (b) ‘ had begun to weaken as a consonant in Ptolemaic times, and the mere fact that no symbol for it 
was deemed necessary at the time when the Coptic script was formulated, indicates that it had all but 
vanished in the spoken language. However, indication that its original presence was still felt is shown in two 
ways. First, the presence of the vowel ‘a’ where ‘o’ or ‘e’ would normally be expected; e.g. kaa.3 ‘To place 
him’ from old *hŏ3‘ef → *ha‘ef → kaa.3 (curved underlines). This preference for vowel sound ‘a’ is also noted 
with some forms which originally contained 3; e.g. sa ‘Back’ for se (old s3). Secondly, the presence of a 
doubled vowel; e.g. ouaab ‘Holy’ (old w‘b), 4wwt ‘To cut’ (old š‘d). In Bohairic this doubling of vowels is no 
longer observed; e.g. ouab and 4wt, showing that the old Ayin had finally disappeared. Note: The original 
presence of ‘ in other parts of the consonantal root is occasionally noted by this doubling of a vowel; e.g. 
mhh4e ‘Crowd’ (old mš‘), pwwne ‘To return’ (old pn‘), etc.
§7. The Vowels are seven in number:
                        short                 long
A sound
a
i  (or h)
E sound
e
h
O sound
o
w (or ou)
h, o or w always stand in accented syllables. The others can stand in syllables accented or not.
§8. The Diphthongs are formed by a vowel and one of the semi-consonants (two semi-syllables). (a) With 
i+: ai+, ei+, hi+, oi+, wi+, oui+; e.g. e6rai+ ‘Upwards’, pei+- ‘This’, hi+ ‘House’, 6amoi+ ‘Oh that!’, pwi+ ‘Mine’, 
moui+ ‘Lion’. (b) With u: au, eu; e.g. nau ‘To see’, peu.6ht ‘Their heart’.
§9. Note: hu (old hou), iou, oou, wou, ouou ought to be considered as forming two sounds rather than as 
a diphthong; e.g. 3.nhu ‘He is coming’, siou ‘Star’, ntoou ‘They’, 6wou ‘Themselves’, nou.ou ‘Theirs’.
Change of Consonants:
§10. Before b, m, p the letter n changes to m; e.g. m.baampe (for n.baampe) ‘The goats’, m.maein (for 
n.maein) ‘The signs’,76m.p.kosmos (for 6n.p.kosmos) ‘In the world’. Note 1: When n stands before m or p 
functioning as Sonant Consonants (§23), it does not change; e.g. 6n.m-.man4wpe ‘In the dwelling places’. 
Note 2: In some old texts n is occasionally assimilated with the following consonant if this is b, l or r; e.g. 
l.laos (for n.laos) ‘The people’, r.rwme (for n.rwme) ‘The humans’.
§11. Before ` the letter s changes to 4 (but not in Bohairic); e.g. 4a`e ‘To speak’ (Boh sa`i), e4`e ‘If’ (Boh 
is`e).
§12. There is a very common tendency in Coptic to contract two similar consonants into one. This is 
especially the case with n; e.g. tet.na.2w (for tetn.na.2w) ‘You will remain’, ne.3.bwk an (for n.ne3.bwk an) 
5

--- Page 6 ---
‘He was not going’; cf also mn.th (for mnt.th) ‘Fifteen’, `ou.th (for `out.th) ‘Twenty-five’.
§13. Metathesis is common.
 
p / t
  e.g.  swpt, swtp ‘To choose’; opt, otp ‘Enclosed’
b / l
  e.g. sblte, slbte ‘To roll over’ 
l / m
  e.g. loome, moole ‘Bait’ 
s / 4
  e.g. sw4, 4ws ‘To be humbled’
s / 6
  e.g. os6=, o6s= ‘To reap’ 
6 / t
  e.g. taq (tat6), ta6t ‘Lead’ 
2 / s
  e.g.  w2s, ws2 ‘To anoint’
—and many others. Note: mn-- ‘With’ before nouns, but nm-ma= before pronominal suffixes.
Change of Vowels:
§14. After m and n, w regularly changes to ou; e.g. mour (for mwr) ‘To bind’, nou`e (for nw`e) ‘To throw’. 
Note: An exception to this rule is when the 2nd plural suffix -tn is attached to a stem ending in o; e.g. 
mmw.tn (stem mmo=) ‘You’. But note nou.tn (not nw.tn) ‘Yours’. Occasionally w changes to ou after 4, ` or 
2; e.g. 4ou4t (for 4w4t) ‘Window’, `ou3 (for `w3) ‘To be costly’, 2ouna2 (for 2wna2) ‘Cloak’.
§15. Before 6 and 4 when it represents the old h (curved underline), the vowel o changes to a; e.g. ma6.3 (for 
mo6.3) ‘To fill it’, pa6.s ‘To break her’, oua4.3 (for ouo4.3) ‘To desire it’. The same change of o to a in words 
which do not contain 6 or 4 is to be attributed in most cases to the original presence of Ayin (§6).
§16. Contraction of Vowels.
Short e occasionally falls away before ou; e.g. soun- (for seoun-) the construct form of sooun ‘To know’, 
sou- (for seou-) the construct form of siou ‘Star’. But normally, contraction takes place; e.g. meut- (for 
meout-) the construct form of mouout ‘To kill’, ne.un- (for ne.oun) ‘There was’. Likewise a before ou 
contracts to au; e.g. a.u.son bwk ebol (for a.ou.son bwk ebol) ‘A brother went out’. When the vowel ou is 
followed by the consonant ou, a contraction to a single semi-consonant takes effect; e.g. nter.ouw (for 
nter.ou.ouw) ‘When they ceased’, mp.ouw4t (for mp.ou.ouw4t) ‘They did not worship’, ouoein (for 
ou ouoein
.
) ‘A light’.
Chapter II. Syllables and Words.
§17. In theory every syllable in a word must begin with a consonant; e.g. bwl, son, kba, etc. But 
many words violate this rule by beginning with a vowel; e.g. wp, erhu, o`, etc. This apparent contradiction 
can be explained by reference to the hieroglyphic forms, which show that originally they commenced with a 
weak consonant, usually the glottal stop or Ayin (§6); thus wp is derived from ’ip, erhu from ’iryw, w` from 
‘d3, wtp from 3tp.
§18. Two kinds of syllables exist: the open and the closed syllable. Open syllables end in a vowel, closed 
syllables in a consonant. The general rule may be stated: An open syllable demands a long vowel, e.g. sw, 
ph; a closed syllable demands a short vowel, e.g. no2, ran. But there are many exceptions to this rule. For 
example, a long vowel can stand in a closed syllable when it is accented (§19); e.g. 3.bwl ‘He loosens’. And 
there are numerous examples of short vowels standing in open syllables; e.g. pe ‘Heaven’, 6o ‘Face’, etc. 
These exceptions can be explained by reference to the hieroglyphic forms, which reveal endings lost by the 
Coptic period, and also weak consonants which even though written in the old script had long ceased to be 
pronounced. Thus pe originated from old pt vocalized *pet. 6o is the final form of a word which once 
contained the weak consonant r (hr, vocalized *hor → ho [h's dotted]).
§19. Accent or Tone. One syllable in a word or compound-word bears the accent or tone-stress. This 
accented syllable is called the Tone Syllable, and its vowel the Formative Vowel. The Tone Syllable 
is always the last or the last but one in the word; e.g. 3.bwl ‘He loosens’, tone on the last syllable; 3.swtm 
‘He hears’, tone on the last but one. Note: Where two vowels stand together, for the purpose of the tone 
they are reckoned as one vowel; e.g. 6ww.k pronounced hó-ok: ‘Thou also’.
§20. The tone does not remain on the same syllable: when, for example, the word is augmented by the 
addition of a suffix, the tone moves further towards the end of the word; the original tone syllable, having 
lost the accent, becomes unstressed and its vowel shortens; e.g. 5.na.bwl ‘I will loose’, 5.na.bl.thutn ‘I 
will loose you’, solsl ‘To comfort’ slswl.k ‘To comfort thee’. Note: As a general rule, in monosyllabic 
words augmented by another syllable the tone does not shift; e.g. eiwt ‘Father’ plural eiote, pe ‘Heaven’ 
plural phue. However, a few plurals show exceptions to this rule; e.g. son ‘Brother’ plural snhu, 6wb ‘Thing’ 
plural 6bhue.

§21. When two or more words are placed closely together to form a compound noun or group, the tone falls 
on the last word only and the Formative Vowel of the preceding word or words shortens; e.g. 6ou-mise 
‘Birthday’ (from 6oou ‘Day’ and mise ‘To give birth to’), pei+.rwme ‘This man’ (from pai+ ‘This’ and rwme ‘Man’), 
skrkr.p.kot ‘To revolve the wheel’ (from skorkr ‘To roll’ and p.kot ‘The wheel’).
§22. Vocalic changes caused by moving of tone. The loss of tone, as has been noted (§20, 21), meant that 
long vowels shortened; but if the vowel was already short, it either remains unaltered or disappears 
altogether; e.g. 6wtb ‘To kill’, 6etb.p.rwme ‘To kill the man’; a3 ‘Flesh’, a3.rir ‘Swine's flesh’; rwme ‘Man’, 
rm.rakote ‘Man of Alexandria, Alexandrian’; 4wp ‘To receive, 4wp.6mot ‘To give thanks’ (lit. To receive 
grace). The last two examples illustrate the tendency for a vowel to disappear completely. This is a feature of 
the Sahidic dialect, and is most commonly found when the syllable ends in b, l, m, n, r, less commonly when 
it ends in s, 4, 3, or 6.
§23. The unbroken succession of consonants in Coptic MSS makes word division a matter of extreme 
difficulty. What is to be made of such a group as ntntmntenot, in which only one vowel is clearly 
discernable? How is such a succession of consonants to be divided into syllables? Fortunately the writers of 
Sahidic MSS were aware of this difficulty, and invented a simple method to aid the reader: the Superlinear 
Stroke, or Syllable Marker. By placing a stroke over the letters thus b-, l-, m-, n- and p-, and less frequently k-, 
s-, 4-, 3- and 6-, the correct division into syllables is indicated. Thus in good MSS, ntntmnteiwt would appear 
as n-tn-tmn-teiwt, indicating the syllabic division n-.tn-.t.mn-t.eiwt. Though the stroke is not a vowel sign, 
and must not be thought of as similar to the Hebrew Vocal Shewa, it is to be noted that this syllable 
marker in fact appears over those consonants which can function as sonants. This sonant 
characteristic of some consonants is observable in modern spoken English; e.g. ‘Tunnel’, but pronounced 
‘Tun-l’, ‘Patten’ pronounced ‘Pa-tn’, or ‘Tottenham’ (a place name) pronounced locally as ‘Tót-num’. The last 
two examples might be written in Coptic letters, patn- and totn-m-. (Cf. the tl ending common in Mexican 
Nahuatl; e.g. chocolatl ‘Chocolate’ and coyotl ‘Coyote’.) For convenience in reading Coptic aloud, the student 
may use a short ‘e’ sound before consonants bearing the syllable marker, so long as he fully understands 
that this is not in itself a vowel sign. Thus n-.tn-.sooun- an ‘We do not know’ may be read en-ten-so-wen an, 
and bwk ng--.r-.6wb ‘Go and work’ as bok neg-er-hob.
§24. Nouns ending in -e which have lost the tone through being closely joined to another word, lose this 
final vowel; e.g. rm-.n-.khme ‘Black-man, Egyptian’: from rwme ‘Man’ and n-.khme ‘Of black’, 4r-.n-.ouwt ‘Only 
son’ from 4hre ‘Son’ and n-.ouwt ‘Of one’.
§25. Three Forms or Vowel Structures exist: Absolute, Construct, and Pronominal. They extend to 
almost all parts of speech, but it is in the verb that they play the most important role. It must be noted that 
not all the three forms are necessarily found in all words. Only a few nouns have a Pronominal Form (§38). 
Some of the verbs have only the Absolute Form; e.g. 6mom ‘To be hot’. Further, the three forms are always 
different from one another; e.g. sw6e ‘To weave’ Absolute Form, whereas sa6t is the Construct Form and 
the Pronominal Form.
§26. The Absolute Form is the Full Form and is phonetically independent of any other word, i.e. it is 
separated in pronunciation from the words which follow it. This form always bears the tone; e.g. rwme 
‘Man’, bwl ‘To loose’, swtm- ‘To hear’. Note: In Crum's Coptic Dictionary (www.metalog.org/files/crum.html), 
words are given in the Absolute Form, but it should be noted that the order of words is determined according 
to their consonantal structure; e.g. terpose, trir, trre, twrt, tortr, etc.
§27. The Construct Form is used when a word is closely united with a following word. In this case the 
word in the Construct loses the tone, which passes to its complement. The loss of the tone results in an 
abridged form exhibiting the vowels in a shortened form (§21, 22); e.g. rm-.5me ‘Townsmen’ (from rwme and 
5me ‘Town’), 6etb.p.son ‘To kill the brother’ (from 6wtb ‘To kill’ and p.son ‘The brother’). Note: Greek verbs and 
other foreign loan verbs, as well as late verbs, have no Construct Form. Likewise, they have no Pronominal 
Form.
§28. The Pronominal Form is that used with the Personal Suffixes, and in contrast to the Construct it 
bears the tone; e.g. kot.3- ‘To build it’ but Construct ket.p.hi+ ‘To build the house’, 6otb.3- ‘To kill him’ but 
Construct 6etb.p.son ‘To kill the brother’. In certain verbal classes (§166, 168-69), the effect of the addition 
of the suffixes is to draw the tone further to the end of the word; e.g. solsl ‘To console’ but slswl.3- ‘To 
console him’, moste ‘To hate’ but mestw.k ‘To hate thee’. Note: An abridged form of the Pronominal Form 
appears in the case of the Possessive Article (§50) which takes the suffixes, as well as in the case of the 
Auxiliaries of the Verb which also take the suffixes. These forms do not bear the tone, which passes to the 
thing possessed or the action performed, e.g. pek.4a`e ‘Thy word’, a.3.swtm ‘He heard’.
§29. As has been noted (§22), in MSS no division is observed between words. The following short extract is 
taken from Zoega, Catalogus Codd. Copticorum &c., 1810 (hereafter Z; Plate V, p.338):

pe`ep6llona3`etwoungngpwtngta6o3auwnteunoua3ou`aia3twouna3ta6epe3eiwtauwntei6eaubwkepeuhieura4e
Transcribed in printed books thus:

The old man said to him: Rise up and run and meet him. And immediately he was whole, he rose up, he met his father, and in this way they went to their house rejoicing.
§30. In printed texts an arbitrary division of the original is made, in which the auxiliary and the verbal form 
are joined together and the direct object added by means of a hyphen; e.g. auw a.3.6etb-p.rwme ‘And he 
killed the man’. Note: In Crum's Coptic Dictionary and in most Grammars, the hyphen is used to show at a 
glance the forms of verbs and prepositions which occur before a noun or pronoun; thus the Construct form 
of a verb or preposition before another noun is printed with a single hyphen; e.g. r--, pe`e-, e-, n--, etc. 
When the form is that used with Pronoun Suffixes (the Pronominal Form), a double hyphen is used; e.g. 
aa=, pe`a=, ero=, m-mo=.
§31. The Long Superlinear Stroke is not to be confused with the syllable marker; it often occurs in MSS at 
the end of a line over the last letter and represents a final n; e.g. auw n.5.na. kaa.k nsw.i+ a\ = auw 
n-.5.na.kaa.k n-sw.i+ an ‘And I will not forsake thee’ (Josh 1:5; §396).
§32. Abbreviations of certain Greek titles and nouns are very frequent, also with a Long Superlinear 
Stroke: e.g.:
 i\s\
 i+hsous
 i\h\l\
 israhl
 i\l\h\m\
 i+hrousalhm
 k\e\
 kurie
 p\n\a\
 pneuma
 x\s\
 xristos
(Note also sros for stauros ‘Cross’, and s\5\ for both stauros and σταυρουν ‘To crucify’.)
§33. Greek words were spelled phonetically, so it can be difficult to recognize the originals; e.g.:
 6eirhnh
  ειρηνη
 trapuza
  τραπεζα
 anixe
  ανεχειν
 arna
  αρνεισθαι
 eti
  αιτειν
 kelebin
  πελεκυς (an interesting example of metathesis) 
 5atrepei
  διατρεπειν
 tihkhma
  διηγηµα
 6enation
  ενατον
 6ikwn
  εικων
 6ebrize
  υβριζειν
§34. Punctuation. In the MSS there is no spacing between words. The only punctuation used was the single 
stop (·) to divide sentences. The double stop (:) was employed at the end of paragraphs. In printed texts 
Greek punctuation is usually employed. In this Internet version (2007), dots have been added between word 
elements to facilitate parsing.

§36. Uses: (a) After prepositions; e.g. ero.k ‘To thee’, na.n ‘For us’, m-mw.tn- ‘With you’, 4aro.3 ‘To him’, 
nm-ma.s ‘With her’.
§37. (b) As subject of verbal auxiliaries; e.g. a.3.`oo.s ‘He said it’, ne.n.swtm- ‘We were hearing’, 
mare.k.bwk ‘Mayest thou go!’. (c) As subject of the Old Conjugation form of the verb (§180); e.g. pe`a.3 
‘He says’, naa.k ‘Thou art great’. (d) As the object of the verb; e.g. a.3.bol.3 ‘He loosed him’, 3.na.6otb.3 
‘He will kill him’. (e) Reflexively; e.g. a.3.kot.3 e.m-.maqhths (Lk 10:2) ‘He turned himself to the disciples’, 
a.3.oue4 tmeio.3 ‘He wished to justify himself’ (Lk 10:29).
§38. (f) As possessives, used with a few nouns only. Most of these are parts of the body, those marked with 
an asterisk* being especially common in Compound Prepositions (§272):
an=
‘Beauty’
touw=
‘Breast’
arh`=
‘End’
4ant=
‘Nose’
eiat=
‘Eye’
6na=
‘Will, desire’
koun=
‘Bosom’
*6ra=
‘Face’
*rw=
‘Mouth’
6ra=
‘Voice, sound’
rnt=
‘Name’
*6ht=
‘Front’
*rat=
‘Foot’
6ht=
‘Belly’
*sw=
‘Back’
*6th=
‘Heart’
sount=
‘Price’
6th=
‘Edge, lip’
*toot=
‘Hand’
`w=
‘Head’
—e.g. rw.3 ‘His mouth’, rat.k- ‘Thy foot’, e`w.i+ ‘Upon me’ (lit. To my head), n-.6ht.3- ‘In it’ (lit. In its heart).
§39. Forms of the Suffix. 1 pers sing: The normal ending i+ falls away when the noun or verb stem ends 
in t; e.g. rat ‘My foot’, 6ht ‘My belly’, n-t ‘To carry me’, moout ‘To kill me’. Note: Some verbs having a 
pronominal form with a as the final letter take t as the suffix ending (originally these verbs possessed an ending 
in t); e.g. taa.t ‘To give me’ (taa= being the pronominal form of 5), aa.t ‘To make me’ (aa= from eire), 
kaa.t ‘To lay me’ (kaa= from kw). When, however, the stem ends in a consonant, the ending i+ is replaced 
by t; e.g. 6obs.t ‘Clothe me’, tn-noou.t ‘Send me’, arh`.t ‘My end’.
§40. 2 fem sing: -e is attached to the stem when it ends in a consonant; e.g. eiat.e ‘Thy eye’, toot.e 
‘Thy hand’, n-t.e ‘To bring thee’, otp.e ‘To surround thee’. -e is omitted when the stem, being a noun or a 
preposition, ends in a vowel; e.g. `w ‘Thy head’, 6th ‘Thy heart’, ero ‘To thee’. If the noun or preposition 
ends in a, this stem vowel gives place to the e of the suffix; e.g. 6r.e ‘Thy face’ (6ra=), n.e ‘For thee’ (na=). 
-e is likewise omitted after verbal stems ending in o, w, ou; e.g. kto ‘To turn thee’. But when the verbal 
stem ends in a (§39n), the suffix takes the form -te; e.g. taa.te ‘To give thee’.
§41. 3 fem sing: -s is regularly used to express the neuter object ‘It’, especially after the verb `w ‘To say’, 
which must take an object; e.g. a.3.`oo.s ‘He said it’.
§42. 2 com pl: -tn-. When the stem ends in a or o, the vowel is lengthened; e.g. 6ra.n ‘Our face’ but 
6rh.tn- ‘Your face’, ero.k ‘To thee’ but erw.tn- ‘To you’, ta6o.3 ‘To place him’ but ta6w.tn- ‘To place you’. 
Note: m-mw.tn- ‘You’ and nou.tn- ‘Yours’ (§14). When the stem ends in a consonant, the form -thutn- is used; 
e.g. 6ht.thutn- ‘Your heart’ e`n.thutn- ‘Without you’. It is to be noted that when this suffix is employed as 
the object after a verb, the verb is in the Construct Form, and not in the Pronominal Form; e.g. twoun.k ‘To 
raise thee’ but toun.thutn- ‘To raise you’, bol.k ‘To loose thee’ but bel.thutn- ‘To loose you’.
§43. 3 com pl: -ou is the usual form of the suffix; e.g. rat.ou ‘Their feet’, ero.ou ‘To them’, 6w.ou 
‘Themselves’, ta6o.ou ‘To place them’. When the stem ends in a, the diphthong au is formed; e.g. taa.u 
(for taa.ou) ‘To give them’, 6ra.u (for 6ra.ou) ‘Their face’.
§44. -sou appears as the 3 com pl suffix after the verbs s6ai ‘To write’, tn-noou and `oou ‘To send’, 
2wou ‘To make narrow’, and ari, the imperative of eire ‘To do, make’; e.g. tn-noou.sou ‘To send them’, 
ari.sou ‘Make them!’ Occasionally this suffix appears in the form -se; e.g. 3.na.tn-noou.se ‘He will send 
them’ (Mt 21:23).
§45. The Independent Pronouns.

In contrast to the Suffix Pronoun, the Independent Pronoun can stand in its Absolute Form quite 
independently of any other word in the sentence, and as a result bears a more of less emphatic meaning; 
e.g. n-to.3 de a.3.ouw4b- ‘He (and no one else) answered’ (lit. He, he answered).
§46. Uses. (1) To emphasize the subject of a sentence when it is a pronoun, e.g. anok 5.`w m-mo.s nh.tn- 
‘I, I say it to you’. (2) In the 1st and 2nd persons to express the subject in non-verbal sentences (§301); e.g. 
anok ou.rwme ‘I (am) a man’. The Construct Forms are more common in use than the Absolute, e.g. 
ang-.p.4hre m-.p.noute ‘I (am) the Son of God’. (3) To strengthen the possessive adjective (§50); e.g. anok 
pa.6ht ‘My heart’, pa.eiwt anok ‘My father’. (4) To strengthen the suffix; e.g. a.3.2n-t.3- n-to.3 ‘He found 
him’ (Z 294).
§47. The Pronoun of Emphasis or Contrast: 6w(w)= ‘Self, also’ or ‘But on the other hand’, takes the 
suffixes:
Singular
Plural
1 com
 6ww.t, 6ww, 6w
1 com
 6ww.n

2 com
 6wt.thutn-
2 fem
 6ww.te
3 masc
 6ww.3
3 com
 6w.ou
3 fem
 6ww.s
It is frequently used in conjunction with the Independent Pronoun; e.g. nto 6ww.te bhqleem ‘Thou also 
Bethlehem’ (Mt 2:6), n-twtn- 6wt.thutn- ari.sou na.u n-.tei+.6e ‘You also do thus (lit. in this way) to them’ (Mt 
7:12), n-twtn- 6wt.thutn- ete.tn `w m-mo.s `e ang-.nim ‘But you on the other hand, who do you say I 
(am)?’ (Mt 16:15).

These forms are prefixed to substantives, and agree in number and gender; e.g. pek.son ‘Thy brother’, 
te3.s6ime ‘His wife’, nen.bir ‘Our baskets’. Note: The possessive article can be used with those nouns 
which take the suffixes (§38); e.g. pe3.ro or rw.3 ‘His mouth’, pen.6ht or 6th.n ‘Our heart’.
§51. The Possessive Article.
Singular masc
Singular fem
Plural
pa-
ta-
na-
These are used before a noun with the meaning ‘Belonging to’; e.g. pa.t.4eleet ‘The bridegroom’ (lit. He 
belonging to the bride), na.nestorios ‘The Nestorian Heresy’ (lit. The things belonging to Nestorius).
§52. The Demonstrative Pronoun. ‘This’ and ‘These’ have two forms:
 
Absolute
Construct
 
Absolute
Construct
Sing masc ‘This’
pai+
pei+-
Plural ‘These’
nai+
nei+-
Sing fem ‘This’
tai+
tei+-
The Absolute Form is used as a substantive, pai+ and nai+ being used in a neuter sense for ‘This’ and 
‘These’; e.g. pai+ de ne.3.`w m-mo.s ‘This one was saying’ (Z 311), tai+ te qe ‘This is the way’, pai+ et.sh6 
‘This which is written (i.e. This which follows)’ (Z 324), pet.ei+re.n-.nai+ ‘He who does these things’. The 
Construct Form stands before its noun; e.g. pei+.ka6 ‘This land’, tei+.s6ime ‘This woman’, nei+.rwme 
‘These men’.
§53. The Demonstrative Pronouns. ‘That’ and ‘Those’ also have two forms:
Sing masc ‘That’
ph, p(e)-
Plural ‘Those’
nh, n(e)-
Sing fem ‘That’
th, t(e)-
The Absolute form is used as a substantive; e.g. nh de m-p.ou.eime ‘Those did not know’ (Jn 10:6), nh 
thr.ou ‘All those (things)’ (Mt 18:23).
§54. As the Construct Form is used to express the Definite Article (§80), in order to express such a phrase 
as ‘That man’ a relative clause is employed: et.m-mau ‘Who (or which) is there’; e.g. p.rwme et.m-mau 
‘That man’, n-.6m-6al et.m-mau ‘Those servants’.
§55. The Interrogative Pronouns (for uses, §344): a4 ‘Who, what, which?’, nim ‘Who, which?’, ou 
‘What?’, ouhr ‘How much?’, a6ro= (always with suffix) ‘Why?’
• Nouns •
§56. Coptic recognizes two genders, Masculine and Feminine. As a general rule masc nouns end in a 
consonant or a short vowel (a, e, o), and fem nouns end in -e (-i in Bohairic) or a long vowel (i, h, w, ou); 
e.g. masc hrp ‘Wine’, 6llo ‘Old man’, la ‘Slander’, toou ‘Mountain’; fem hpe ‘Number’, 6llw ‘Old 
woman’, 6ih ‘Path’, ri ‘Cell’. 
§57. But there are many exceptions to this rule, especially in respect to words ending in -e. Thus the 
following are all masc: beke ‘Wage’, rwme ‘Man’, 4hre ‘Son’, 4te ‘Mast’, 5me ‘Village’, 4e ‘Wood’. Note 
also the following masculines ending in a long vowel: eiw ‘Donkey’, 3w ‘Hair’, ouw ‘News’. Examples of fem 
nouns ending in a consonant are: ba4or ‘Fox’, melwt ‘Ceiling’, mort ‘Beard’.
§58. Nouns formed by the addition of the suffixes of the 3rd masc sing and 3rd fem sing clearly indicate their 
gender. This type of noun formation is only met with occasionally; e.g. Suffix -3 masc gender: na6b.3- ‘Yoke’ 
(from nou6b ‘To yoke’), 4l-6.3- ‘Fear’ (4la6 ‘Be afraid’), mo`6.3- and mo`.6- ‘Girdle’, 3o2.3- ‘Robber’ (3w2e ‘To 
11

--- Page 12 ---
seize’); Suffix -s fem gender: kot.s ‘Circuit’ (from kwte ‘To turn’), soou6.s ‘Collection’ (swou6 ‘To gather’), 
4ol.s ‘Booty’ (4wl ‘To rob’), 4op.s ‘Reception’ (4wp ‘To receive’).
§59. Compound Nouns. By means of a prefix, which may be a noun, a verb or a particle, placed before 
another noun or verbal form, a large number of Compound Nouns were constructed. The prefix, when it 
stands immediately before the noun or verbal form, is always in the Construct Form. However, it must be 
noted that some of the prefixes must be connected to their noun or verbal form by the particle n-.
§60. Noun Prefixes. The most common of these are:
(a) eiep- (construct of eiope ‘C  raft
 
 ’), fem gender; e.g. eiep.noub ‘Goldsmith's craft’, eiep.4e 
‘Woodworker's craft’.
(b) ma- ‘P  lace
 
 ’ followed by n- and verbal form, masc gender; e.g. ma.n-.4wpe ‘Dwelling-place’, ma.n-.pwt 
‘Place of refuge’.
(c) rm-- (construct of rwme ‘M
  an
  ’) followed by n-; e.g. rm-.n-.5me ‘Villager’, rm-.m-.me ‘Honest person’ (lit. Man of 
truth), rm-.n-.khme ‘Egyptian’. Note: The particle n- is usually omitted before the names of cities and towns; 
e.g. rm-.rakote ‘Alexandrian’.
(d) sa- ‘Man’ followed by the particle n- and noun, forms nouns expressing profession or even character; e.g. 
sa.n-.hrp ‘Wine merchant’, sa.n-.aba2hein ‘Glass blower’, sa.n-.kot ‘Guileful person’.
(e) 6am- ‘C  raftsman
 
 ’ is used without n- to describe various kinds of workers; e.g. 6am.klle ‘Boltsmith’, 
6am.noub ‘Goldsmith’, 6am.4e ‘Carpenter’.
(f) 4ou- ‘Use, value’ with the following verbal form has the meaning ‘W
  orthy of, fit for
 
 ’; e.g. 4ou.moste 
‘One fit to be hated’ (§249).
§61. Note also: (g) eie6- (eiw6e ‘F  ield
 
 ’); e.g. eie6.eloole ‘Vineyard’, eie6.4hn ‘Grove’.
(h) eier- (eioor ‘C  anal
 
 ’); e.g. eier.o ‘River’ (lit. Great canal).
(i) s5- (stoi ‘S  mell
 
 ’); e.g. s5.nou3e ‘Perfume’ (lit. Good smell), s5.bwwn ‘Stench’ (lit. Evil smell).
(j) 6wb- ‘Work’, so 6wb.n-.2i` ‘Handiwork.’
§62. Verb Prefixes. The characteristic feature of the Verb Prefix in Compound Nouns is the presence of the 
vowel a after the first radical of the verbal root; e.g. ouam- (from ouwm ‘To eat’), matn- (from m-ton ‘To rest’). 
This form originated from the old participle, and still retains the participial meaning in expressing a 
characteristic, especially in describing trades or occupations; e.g. ouam.sno3 ‘Bloodthirsty man’ (lit. Eater of 
blood), mai+.eoou ‘Lover of glory’, `ai+.beke ‘Hireling’ (lit. Taker of wages), mane.rir ‘Swineherd’, 
sa6t.6boos ‘Cloth-weaver’, 3ai.na6b ‘Yoke-bearer’. Note: This verbal form has been named Participium 
Conjunctum, and is indicated in Crum's Coptic Dictionary by the abbreviation ‘pc’.
§63. Particle Prefixes. (a) mn-t- (from moute ‘To call’) forms abstract feminine nouns; e.g. mn-t.eiwt 
‘Fatherhood’, t.mn-t.son ‘The Brotherhood’, mn-t.swtp ‘Choice’.
(b) re3- with the verbal form expresses a noun of agency, and is used regardless of gender or number; e.g. 
re3.swtm ‘Hearer’, re3.w4 ‘Reader’, re3.moout ‘Dead man’. Note: The verbal form can take an object 
after it; e.g. re3.r.nobe ‘Sinner’ (lit. One who does sin), re3.6i.la ‘Slanderer’.
(c) 2in- (for `i n--, §5.f) with verbal form expresses nouns of action, which are feminine; e.g. 2in.libe 
‘Madness’, 2in.kime ‘Movement’, 2in.4a`e ‘Saying, speech’.
(d) at- (ate before double consonants) forms, with nouns and verbal forms, a negative adjective (§101ff); e.g. 
at.nobe ‘Sinless’, at.tako ‘Imperishable’. When the complement is a verb it can take an object, and it is to 
be noted that when used in a passive sense transitive verbs must take an object, in such cases a pronominal 
object; e.g. at.sont.3- ‘Uncreated’ (lit. Without to create it), at.nau ero.3 ‘Invisible’ (lit. Without to see it).
§64. (e) Occasionally an- in collective numerals; e.g. an.taiou ‘Fiftieth’.
(f) Occasionally e- to form nouns of profession: e.g. e.kwt ‘Builder’, e.4wt ‘Trader’.
§65. Number. Although singular and plural forms are found, as well as a few words preserving the old dual 
endings (e.g. spotou ‘Lips’, snau ‘Two’), the majority of words show the same form in both the 
singular and the plural, distinction in number being indicated by the form of the Article (§80, 85); 
e.g. p.rwme ‘The man’, n-.rwme ‘The men’, ou.rwme ‘A man’, 6en.rwme ‘(Some) men’, t.4eere ‘The 
daughter’, n-.4eere ‘The daughters’. Even with those nouns which have preserved the old plural endings, it 
is quite common to find the singular form used with the plural Article; e.g. abwk ‘Raven’ plural n-.abooke or 
n-.abwk, 6to ‘Horse’ plural 6en.6twwr or 6en.6to.
§66. Plural Formations, Masc Nouns: Ending in o form plurals in wou; e.g. kro ‘Shore’ plural krwou, 
eiero ‘River’ eierwou, ro ‘Door’ (when meaning ‘Mouth’ takes a suffix, §38) rwou, rro ‘King’ rrwou, 4teko 
‘Prison’ 4tekwou, `o ‘Armpit’ `wou. Note: 6l-lo ‘Old man’ has the plural 6l-loi.
§67. Ending in e form the plural in hu or eeu: (a) -hu; e.g. ame ‘Herd’ plural amhu. Likewise amre ‘Baker’, 
la4ane ‘Village officer’, 4ne ‘Net’, 4te ‘Mast’, 4`e ‘Locust’, 2me ‘Gardener’. Note: r-pe ‘Temple’ and beke 
12

--- Page 13 ---
‘Wage’ show fem plurals r-phue and bekhue.
§68. (b) -eeu; e.g. blle ‘Blind man’ plural bleeu. Likewise mn-tre ‘Witness’, sabe ‘Wise man’, rm- 6e
.
 
‘Freeman’, 6ae ‘End’, 6atre ‘Twin’, `ise ‘Height’, 2ale ‘Lame man’. Note: `a`e ‘Enemy’ shows plural 
forms `i`eeu and `in`eeu.
§69. Ending in t preceded by a long vowel form plural ate; e.g. barwt ‘Bronze’ barate. Likewise besnht 
‘Smith’, ekwt ‘Builder’ (but see §70), erht ‘Vow’, remht ‘Tenth part’, 6alht ‘Bird’, 6ouht ‘Passenger’, 
6oueit ‘First’, rwt ‘Growth’.
§70. Note: Irregular are eiwt ‘Father’ plural eiote, e4wt ‘Trader’ plural e4ote, 6ht ‘Lip, edge’ plural 
6teeu; ekwt (‘Builder’, §69) sometimes shows ekote.
§71. Ending in t preceded by a short vowel also form plural ate; e.g. ebot ‘Month’ plural ebate. Likewise 
merit ‘Beloved one’ plural merate, sot ‘Dung’, 6ourit ‘Guardian’.
§72. Plural formed by adding -e to the singular form; e.g. 4aar ‘Hair’ 4aare. Likewise `noou ‘Threshing 
floor’, 2amoul ‘Camel’. Note: the following show a vocalic change also: abwk ‘Raven’ plural abooke, 
barw6 ‘Camel’ bara6e, lelou ‘Youth’ lelaue, sa4 ‘Blow’ sh4e, 6oeim ‘Wave’ 6hme, 2erh2 ‘Hunter’ 
2era2e.
§73. Plural formed by moving the tone syllable is shown in the following: son ‘Brother’ plural snhu, 4hre 
‘Son’ 4rhu, 6am ‘Craftsman’ 6mhu, 6wb ‘Thing’ 6bhue. 4om ‘Father-in-law’ shows the plurals 4moui or 
4mwou, and 6o3 ‘Serpent’ the form 6boui.
§74. Some nouns show a ‘broken plural’, i.e. the vowel of the singular form modifies in the plural: (a) a 
becomes au: e.g. ana4 ‘Oath’ plural anau4, likewise `na6 ‘Forearm’ `nau6. But note m-ka6 ‘Pain’ forms the 
plural m-koo6, and so too m-la6 ‘Battle’, m-sa6 ‘Crocodile’. kas ‘Bone’ shows the plural kaas. (b) h  becomes 
ee in 4bhr ‘Friend’ plural 4beer. (c) o becomes oo: e.g. klom ‘Crown’ kloom, likewise sote ‘Arrow’, to4 
‘Border’, ou6or ‘Dog’. But apot ‘Cup’ apht. (d) oo becomes ww: e.g. 6boos ‘Garment’ 6bwws, 2roo2 
‘Seed’ 2rww2. Note: sno3 ‘Blood’ follows this modification, plural snww3. Also `6o ‘Treasure’ and 6to 
‘Horse’, which show as their plurals a6wwr and 6twwr. (e) w becomes oo: e.g. e2w4 ‘Ethiopian’ e2oo4, 
mar`w`e ‘Garment’ mar`oo`e, 2wm ‘Garden’ 2oom. Note: tw4 ‘Ordinance’ shows the plural tww4. 
Note: The following show two forms of the plural: 4ws ‘Herdsman’ 4oos or 4wws, 2erwb ‘Rod’ 2eroob 
or 2erwwb.

§76. Feminine Nouns: Ending in e form the plural in hue; e.g. ape ‘Head’ aphue, pe ‘Heaven’ phue, 6re 
‘Food’ 6rhue.
§77. Ending in h form the plural in ooue; e.g. ou4h ‘Night’ ou4ooue, 6ih ‘Road’ 6iooue. Note: 6ih 
‘Rudder’ forms the plural 6ihu. Note: A few Greek words ending in h form a plural in ooue; e.g. yuxh ‘Soul’ 
yuxooue, epistolh ‘Letter’ epistolooue.
§78. Ending in w also form the plural in ooue; e.g. mrw ‘Harbour’ mrooue. Likewise abw ‘Dragnet’, alw 
‘Snare’, alw ‘Pupil of eye’, rsw ‘Fold’, sbw ‘Teaching’, 6bsw ‘Garment’. Note: e4w ‘Sow (female swine)’

Chapter IV. The Article.
§80. The Definite Article.
Singular masc
p-, pe-
Plural
n--, ne-
Singular fem
t-, te-
In old texts the forms pi-, 5-, ni- are found.
 
Note: In the New Testament ni.ene6 (for n-.ene6) ‘Forever’ and 5.rhnh (for t.eirhnh) ‘The peace’.
§81. The article stands immediately before its substantive. When this begins with a vowel or a single 
consonant, the forms p-, t-, n-- are used; e.g. p.hrp ‘The wine’, p.son ‘The brother’, t.swne ‘The sister’, 
n-.rwme ‘The men’. Note: Occasionally before 6, p- and t- become f- and q- (§3); e.g. f.wb (p.6wb) ‘The 
work’, q.e (t.6e) ‘The manner’. Note: Sometimes when the plural article appears before a vowel, it loses its 
sonant function; e.g. n.asebhs ‘The evil doers’, but n-.asebhs also occurs.
§82. pe-, te-, ne- are used: (a) when the substantive begins with a double consonant or a consonant 
followed by a semi-consonant; e.g. pe.xristos ‘The Christ’, pe.smot ‘The form’, te.s6ime ‘The woman’, 
ne.6bhue ‘The works’, pe.souo ‘The corn’, te.6ih ‘The way’. Note: When the first letter of a double 
consonant is ou, the form of the article is determined by the original formation of  the word; thus p.oumot 
‘The thickness’, p.ourot ‘The rejoicing’. But with other words the article coalesces with ou; e.g. p.eu6or 
‘The dog’, t.eu4h ‘The night’ (§16). (b) When the substantive begins with a double consonant, the first of 
which is functioning as a sonant; e.g. r-pe ‘Temple’ pe.rpe ‘The temple’.
§83. (c) When the substantive is a word denoting time; e.g. pe.6oou ‘The day’, te.rompe ‘The year’.
§84. The Vocative is expressed by means of the Definite Article; e.g. p.eiwt ‘Oh father’, ne.`po 
n-.ne6.boui ‘Oh generations of vipers’.
§85. The Indefinite Article.
 
Sing masc and fem
‘A, An’
ou- (construct of oua ‘One’)
Plural masc and fem
‘Some’
6en- (construct of 6oeine ‘Some’)
 
E.g. ou.rwme ‘A man’, ou.s6ime ‘A woman’, 6en.rwme ‘Some men’. Note: With verbal prefix a- and verbal 
and prepositional prefix e-, contraction with the article is usual; e.g. a.u.son bwk (for a.ou.son bwk) ‘A 
brother went’, 3.swtm e.u.4a`e (for 3.swtm e.ou.4a`e) ‘He hears a word’. Note: In carelessly written MSS 
6n-- often appears for 6en-.
§86. Uses of the Indefinite Article. With Abstract Nouns; e.g. ou.ra4e ‘Joy’, ou.me ‘Truth’. With the 
preposition 6n-- ‘In’, it is frequently used to form adverbs (§246); e.g. 6n-.ou.me ‘Truly’ (lit. In a truth), 
6n-.ou.mn-t.rm-.mao ‘Richly’ (lit. In a wealth, C296a).
§87. With nouns indicating substance or material; e.g. ou.noub mn- ou.libanos mn-.ou.4al ‘Gold and 
frankincense and myrrh’ (Mt 2:11). For use with the Infinitive, §245.
§88. Omission of the Article occurs: (1) In Compound words: (a) When a Compound Noun is formed by 
placing two nouns together, the second noun does not take the article; e.g. 4b-r.6m-6al ‘Fellow servant’, 
ma.m-.pwt ‘Place of refuge’ (§60). Likewise in Compounds in which the second noun is preceded by a 
preposition; e.g. p.baampe 6a.nobe ‘The scapegoat’ (lit. The goat with sin).
§89. (b) When a Compound Noun is formed by placing a verbal form before a noun, the noun is without the 
14

--- Page 15 ---
Article; e.g. se.hrp ‘Wine-drinker’, p.sek.moou ‘The water-drawer’, ou.6al2.6ht ‘A mild person’ (lit. One 
who is sweet of heart).
§90. (c) When a Compound Verb is formed by placing a verbal form either directly before a noun, or by 
linking the two forms indirectly by means of a preposition, the noun does not take the article; e.g. Directly: 
r-.6ik ‘To bewitch’ (lit. To make magic), 5.pa6re ‘To heal’ (lit. To give drugs); Indirectly: 6moos mn- 6ai ‘To be 
married’ (lit. To sit with a husband), ei ebol 6n- swma ‘To die’ (lit. To come out of body). For a list of verbs used 
in forming compounds, §177.
§91. (2) In enumerating nouns, especially when the items are connected by 6i, eie, eite, oude; e.g. 
noub 6i 6at ‘Gold and silver’, eite 6oout eite s6ime eite no2 eite koui+ ‘Both man and woman, both 
great and small’.
§92. (3) In negative sentences and questions expecting a negative answer; e.g. mn- sboui `ose e.pe3.sa6 
‘There is no disciple higher than his teacher’ (Lk 6:40), mhti 4a.u.`eele eloole ebol 6n-.4onte h 
4a.u.ket.3- kn-te ebol 6n-.arooue ‘Are they wont to gather grapes from thorns, or are they wont to pluck 
figs from thistles?’ (Mt 7:16).
§93. (4) In precise adverbial phrases, mostly with preceding preposition; e.g. n-.rou6e ‘At evening’, n-.4wrp 
‘At morning’, n-.kro3 ‘Guilefully’, e.6oun ‘Inwardly’. Note: Without preceding preposition: sop ‘Sometimes’.
§94. (5) With the nouns which can take suffixes (§38). Definition in such cases is implied by the suffix, 
which is in accord with the following word; e.g. koun.3- n-.abra6am ‘The bosom of Abraham’ (lit. His bosom of 
Abraham), rw.ou n-.n.asebhs ‘The mouth of the evildoers’ (lit. Their mouth of the evildoers).
§95. Note: The Greek words qalassa ‘Sea’ and qhbai+s ‘Thebes’ were frequently treated as if they were 
contracted forms for t.6alassa and t.6hbais, and the initial t was mistaken for the fem Definite Article. 
Hence the form n-.6alassa ‘The seas’. However, the correct forms te.qalassa and ne.qalassa do 
occur. Likewise r-ro ‘King’ is really pr-ro (old pr‘3, the Pharaoh of the Bible); the initial p was mistaken for the 
masc Definite Article; hence a plural form ne.rrwou ‘The kings’ (§66).
§96. Apposition. The word in apposition follows the noun which it enlarges, and always takes the Definite 
Article; e.g. hsaias pe.profhths ‘Isaiah the Prophet’, petros p.rwme m-.p.noute ‘Peter, the man of God’. 
Note: Where the word in apposition is a Proper Name, it is introduced by the particle `e- ‘Namely’; e.g. oua 
`e apa paulos ‘One (namely) Apa Paulos’.
§97. The Genitive. The oldest construction of the genitive was formed by placing the noun of possession in 
the Construct Form, before the noun of the possessor in the Absolute Form. This construction had almost 
disappeared in Coptic. The few remaining examples of this construction are the Compound Nouns (§59ff.).
§98. The usual construction is by linking the noun indicating the possession to the noun indicating the 
possessor by means of the particle n-; e.g. t.2i` n-.ou.rwme ‘The hand of a man, t.mn-t.ero n.m-.phue ‘The 
kingdom of the heavens’, p.4hre m-.p.noute ‘The Son of God’. This construction is also widely used in the 
formation of phrases equivalent to adjectives (§101).
§99. In the place of n-, the particle n-te- is used: (1) When the noun indicating the possession has the 
Indefinite Article; e.g. ou.mhh4e n-te.t.polis ‘A multitude of the city’, ou.pneuma n-te.p.noute ‘A Spirit of 
God’. Note: The particle n-ta= can take suffixes; e.g. ou.son n-ta.3 ‘A brother of his’, ou.swne n-te. thutn- 
‘A sister of yours’. Note: When the genitival construction is used as an equivalent for an adjective, especially 
when describing substance, material or type, even though the noun indicating the possession has the 
Definite Article, the particle n- is used; e.g. ou.mappa n-.4n-s ‘A cloth of linen’, ou.maniakhs n-.6at ‘A 
necklace of silver’, ou.4hre n-.ouwt ‘An only son’. (2) n-te is used as the genitive between two Proper 
Names; e.g. bhqleem nte 5.oudaia ‘Bethlehem of Judaea’.
§100. (3) n-te is used when the noun indicating the possession is qualified by an adjective or a phrase 
equivalent to an adjective; e.g. si4e nim nte p.ponhros ‘All the bitterness of depravity’, ou.4hre n-.ouwt 
n-te te3.maau ‘An only son of his mother’, p.ran m-.p.4r-.n-.ouwt n-te.p.noute ‘The name of the only Son of 
God’. Note: After the adjective thr ‘All’, the genitive is as a rule n-; e.g. m-.mn-t.erw.ou thr.ou m-.p.kosmos 
‘All the kingdoms of the world’.
§101. The Adjective. There are few true adjectives. This is due to the fact that the old form of the 
language was rich in adjective-verbs, as well as the fact that even transitive verbs could express the idea of 
a condition arising as a result of an action performed, by means of the old Perfective Form of the verb— in 
Coptic preserved in the Qualitative (§141). Generally speaking the adjective is expressed in Coptic by means 
of a relative clause or by substantives linked together by the genitival n-, less frequently the noun and its 
qualifying substantive are in direct apposition; e.g. 6wb nim ‘Everything’ (noun + true adjective), p.ran 
et.ouaab ‘The name which [is] holy’ (noun + relative clause), ksour n-.noub ‘Ring of gold’ (noun-n--noun).
§102. True adjectives are mostly invariable in number and gender; e.g. alau ‘White’, as or apas ‘Old’, 
bwwn ‘Evil’, brre ‘New, young’, koui+ ‘Little’, nim ‘Every’, nou` ‘Lying’, no2 ‘Great’, ouwt ‘Single’, 4hm 
15

--- Page 16 ---
‘Little’, 6ak ‘Sober’, 6a6 ‘Many’, 6oout ‘Male’.
§103. However, adjectives ending in e generally form the fem in h; e.g. sabe (masc) sabh (fem) ‘Wise’, 
6ae (masc) 6ah (fem) ‘Last’. Note: 4ire (masc) 4eere (fem) ‘Small’, o (masc) w (fem) ‘Great’.
§104. Position of the adjective in relation to its noun. At first sight the syntax of the true adjective seems 
confusing and illogical. But if it is borne in mind that even the few true adjectives were felt to be in the 
nature of substantives, the apparent confusion is accounted for.
§105. The adjective is placed immediately after the noun it qualifies, which is in the Absolute 
Form; e.g. 6wb nim ‘Everything’, rwme nim ‘All men’. This is always the usage with nim. It is a usage much 
less frequent with other adjectives. Examples which may be quoted are: 4hre 4hm ‘Little son’ (fem 4eere 
4hm), ou.6oou ouwt ‘A single day’.
§106. But note that the noun appears in its Construct Form when it precedes one of the following 
Adjectives: o ‘Great’, 4ire ‘Little’, nou3e ‘Good’, bwwn ‘Evil’, 6oout ‘Male’; e.g. eier  o ‘River’ (lit. Great 
canal), rm-p 4ire ‘Famine’ (lit. Year of little), s5 bwwn ‘Evil smell’, 4r- 6oout ‘Male child’.
§107. The adjective follows its noun but is linked to it by n-. This is the most usual construction; e.g. 
pe3.4hre n-.ouwt ‘His only son’, ne.profhths n-.nou` ‘The lying prophets’. In point of fact the adjective is 
treated as if it were a noun, and as such follows the normal construction used to form adjective equivalents, 
i.e. noun-n--noun; e.g. 4a`e n-.4lo3 ‘Shameful saying’ (lit. Saying of shame), bw n-.`oeit ‘Olive tree’ (lit. Tree 
of olive).
§108. But Note: The adjective can also stand before its noun. This is especially common in the case of 
no2 and 6a6; e.g. ou.no2 dipnon ‘A great supper’, 6a6 n-.6ise ‘Much suffering’, pe3.merit n-.son ‘His 
beloved brother’, ou.4hm n-.ne6 ‘A little oil’.
§109. Concord. Where masc and fem forms of the adjective exist, they agree in gender with their noun; 
e.g. p.rwme n-.sabe ‘The wise man’, t.4eere n-.sabh ‘The wise daughter’. Note: Greek adjectives follow 
their noun and usually show the masc for persons, and neuter form for things; e.g. ou.rwme n-.dikaios ‘A 
righteous man’, ne.yuxooue n-.teleion ‘The perfect souls’.
§110. The three adjectives thr= ‘All’, ouaa= ‘Alone, self’, mauaa= ‘Alone, own’, follow their noun and take 
suffixes in accord; e.g. p.kosmos thr.3- ‘All the world’, ntwtn- thr.tn- ‘You all’, n-to.k ouaa.k ‘Thou alone’, 
pe3.ou`ai mauaa.3 ‘His own salvation’.
§111. ke- ‘Other’ is a construct form which stands before its noun; e.g. ke.rwme ‘Another man’, ke.6wb 
‘Another thing’. But note the plural 6en.ke- ‘Others’; e.g. 6en.ke.rwme ‘Other men’, 6en.ke.6bhue ‘Other 
things’. Note: The use of ke in the adverbial phrase n-.ke.sop ‘Again’ (lit. In another time; §283).
§112. ke combines with oua and laau to form the substantive ‘Another’: ke.oua, ke.laau. This form can 
take the Definite Article or the Demonstrative Pronoun; e.g. p.ke.oua ‘The other’, pei+.ke.oua ‘This other’. 
It can also be linked to a following noun by the particle n-; e.g. p.ke.oua n-.rwme ‘The other man’, 
t.ke.ouei n-.rompe ‘The other year’.
§113. When ke stands directly before a noun and is itself preceded by the Definite Article or Possessive 
Article, it conveys the meaning ‘Also’; e.g. p.ke.rwme ‘The man also’, t.ke.rompe ‘The year also’, 
pa.ke.eiwt ‘My father also’. Note: ke is rarely used in the absolute form as a substantive; e.g. pei+.ke or 
tei+.ke ‘This other’, though a plural form kooue is fairly commonly so used; e.g. 6en.kooue ‘Others’, 
n-.kooue ‘The others’, nei+.kooue ‘These others’.
§114. Comparison. Special forms of the adjective to express the comparative or superlative do not exist in 
Coptic. The comparative is expressed by means of the preposition e- or ero= (§261); e.g. peto n-.no2 e.p.r-
pe ‘One who (is) greater than the temple’ (Mt 12:6), 3.`oor ero.i+ ‘He (is) stronger than I’.
§115. The Superlative is sometimes expressed by the use of the adverb e.mate or m-.mate ‘Very, much’ 
placed after the adjective; e.g. ou.toou e.3.`ose e.mate ‘A very high mountain’ (lit. A mountain which [is] 
very high). But frequently the context alone can decide whether or not a superlative meaning is implied; cf Mt 
18:1 where the Coptic p.no2 6n-.t.mn-t.ero n-.m.phue ‘The great one in the kingdom of the heavens’ is the 
Greek µειζων ... εν τη βασιλεια των ουρανων.
Chapter V. The Numerals.
§116. Sahidic writes the numerals in full, and only rarely uses the system founded on the Greek model, in 
which the letters of the alphabet have a numerical value. In Bohairic the Greek system is extensively used. 
To denote that letters had a numerical function, a single stroke was written over them from 1→800 and a 
double stroke for the thousands. Note, in the following table, the odd symbol for 6 (see 
www.metalog.org/files/plumley/plum-049.gif) and the use of the barred  r  for 900.

§118. Composite Numerals. 11-99 were formed by placing the unit expressing the tens before the simple 
unit; e.g. mn-t.4omte ‘13’. Note that 10 and 20 alone have a special form for constructing the composite 
numerals. The single units 1-8 appear in the last form shown in the table (§117); e.g. mn-t.oue (fem mn-
t.ouei) ‘11’, mn-t.snoous (fem mn-t.snoouse) ‘12’, `out.sa43 ‘27’, `out.4mhn ‘28’, maab.th ‘35’, 6me.yis 
‘49’. Note: With a3fte ‘4’ and ase ‘6’ following the analogy of mn-t.a3te ‘14’, `out.a3te ‘24’, mn-t.ase 
‘16’, `ou.tase ‘26’, everywhere t was inserted; e.g. maab.t.a3te ‘34’, 6me.t.ase ‘46’, 43e.t.ase ‘76’. 
Note: The t of th ‘5’ coalesced with the final t of both mn-t- and `out-; thus mn-.th (mn-t.th) ‘15’ and 
`ou.th (`out.th) ‘25’.
§119. Occasionally the tens were combined with the units by means of the conjunction mn- ‘With’; e.g. 
taiou mn- oua ‘51’ (lit 50 with 1).
§120. The hundreds 300-900 and the thousands were formed: (1) with the Construct Form of the unit 
followed by 4e ‘100’ or 4o ‘1000’; e.g. 4mn-t.4e ‘300’, 3tou.4o ‘4000’; (2) with the absolute form of the 
unit followed by n- and 4e or 4o; e.g. 3toou n-.4e ‘400’, sa43 n-.4o ‘7000’, 5ou n-.tba ‘50,000’ (lit. 5 ten 
thousands).
§121. Sometimes the method used to express the thousands is that of employing the tens followed by the 
hundreds; e.g. mht n-.4e ‘1000’ (lit. 10 hundreds), maab n-.4e ‘3000’ (lit. 30 hundreds). Note: 2is.tba ‘5000’ (lit 
Half ten-thousand) (§127).
§122. The ciphers of a number can be written either: (1) without any connecting particle; e.g. e.3.me6 
n-.no2 n-.tb-t e.u.eire n-.4e taeiou 4omte ‘Being full of great fish, making one hundred fifty-three’ (Jn 
21:11); or (2) with mn- ‘With’; e.g. 6me.oue n-.4o mn- 3tou.4e ‘41,400’.
§123. Syntax of the Cardinal Numbers. The numerals precede the noun which they qualify and are linked 
to it by the particle n-; e.g. 3toou n-.rwme ‘Four men’. The numeral agrees in gender with its noun which is 
in the singular; e.g. 4omte n-.ounou ‘Three hours’, tmhte m-.parqenos ‘The ten virgins’. Note: There also 
occurs 4m-t 6wb ‘Three things’ (the numeral being in the Construct Form); and the forms `p- soe ‘Sixth 
hour’ and `p- yite ‘Ninth hour’ (the noun precedes the numeral, and is in the Construct Form).
§124. The numeral ‘One’ is used in two ways: (1) in the full form, when it agrees in gender with its noun, to 
which it is linked by n-; e.g. oua n- ne3
.
.4b-r 6m-6al ‘One of his fellow-servants’, ouei n-.nei+.entolh ‘One of 
17

--- Page 18 ---
these commandments’; or (2) in the toneless form ou- before the noun. As this latter form is used to 
express the Indefinite Article (§85), so that e.g. ou.rwme might be translated either as ‘A man’ or as ‘One 
man’, the numeral is strengthened by the addition of the adjective ouwt ‘Only’ after the noun; e.g. ou.3w 
n-.ouwt ‘One hair’, ou.iwta n-.ouwt h ou.4wl6 n-.ouwt ‘One iota or one dot’ (Mt 5:18).
§125. The numeral ‘Two’ generally follows its noun which is in the singular, and with which it agrees in 
gender; e.g. p.4hre snau ‘Two sons’, p.son snau ‘The two brothers’, t.s6ime sn-te ‘The two women’, t.sn-
te ‘The two’. Note that the linking particle n- is not used. Sometimes the noun is shortened before the 
numeral; e.g. sep snau ‘Two times’, rm-pe sn-te ‘Two years’.
§126. The Cardinals can be used distributively; e.g. oua oua ‘One by one’, snau snau ‘Two by two’. Note: 
p.oua p.oua ‘Each one’ and oua n-.ouwt ‘Single one, each one’.
§127. Fractions. ‘Half’ is expressed either by pa4e; e.g. pa4e n-.te.6in ‘Half the way’, t.pa4e n-.ta.mn-
t.ero ‘The half of my kingdom’ (Mk 6:23); or by 2os, e.g. ou.ma6e ou.2os ‘A cubit [and] a half’. Note that 
the construct form 2is- is also used; e.g. 2is.tba ‘1/2 10,000’, 2is.kite ‘Drachma’ (lit. 1/2 kite). Also cf 
2is.lauo ‘Half-sail’ (i.e. the Fore-sail). Fractions in which ‘One’ is the numerator, e.g. 1/3, 1/5, 1/12, etc., the 
construct form ra- ‘Part, fraction’ is placed before the numeral indicating the denominator; e.g. ra.4omn-t 
‘1/3’, ra.3toou ‘1/4’, ra.soou ‘1/6’. But note re.mht ‘1/10’, which has a plural re.mate (§69). Note: ouwn 
‘Part’ sometimes appears in forming a few fractions; e.g. ouwn snau ‘1/2’, 4omn-t n-.ouwn ‘1/3’.
§128. Multiplication is expressed quite simply by means of the numeral following the noun to which it 
refers, and the numeral itself followed by the noun kwb ‘Doubling’ linked to the numeral by n-; e.g. 4omn-t 
n-.kwb ‘Threefold’, a.u.taue ou.karpos ebol n-.4e n-.kwb ‘They produced fruit a hundredfold’ (Lk 8:8). 
Multiplication of one numeral by another is expressed by n- placed between the two numerals; e.g. sa43- 
n-.43e n-.sop ‘Seventy times seven’ (lit. 7x70 times).
§129. The Ordinal Numbers. These are formed by placing the form me6- (lit. ‘That which completes’, the 
toneless form of mou6 ‘To fill’) before the Cardinal Numbers; e.g. me6.4omn-t ‘Third’, me6.`ouwt ‘Twentieth’. 
Note: The word for ‘First’ 4orp- is generally used for both genders, though a fem 4orpe is occasionally 
found. There is a construct form 4r-p- which stands before its noun; e.g. p.4r-p.tw4 ‘The first 
commandment’, but the absolute form may also be used with the linking n-; e.g. p.4orp- n-.tw4. Another 
word for ‘First’ is 6oueit, fem 6oueite, though in Sahidic this is mostly used as a substantive and rarely 
as an adjective.
§130. When used adjectivally the Ordinals stand either: (1) in front of their noun and linked by n-; e.g. 
p.me6.sa43 n-.sop ‘The seventh time’, p.me6.3toou n-.4wp n-.te.u4h ‘The fourth watch of the night’. Note: 
The old formation p.me6.rwme snau ‘The second man’ (lit. That which two men make complete) and 
t.me6.rompe sn-te (or t.me6.rm-pe sn-te) ‘The second year’, p.me6.sp- snau ‘The second time’; or (2) after 
their noun, linked by n-, e.g. p.mou m-.me6.snau ‘The second death’.
§131. Notation of time. The year which commenced on 29th August (30th in a leap year) consisted of twelve 
months, each containing thirty days. Five extra days (six in a leap year) were added to complete the total of 
365 (366). In Bohairic these days are called ‘The little month’ (pi.kou`i nabot), but in Sahidic the Greek 
επαγοµεναι is always used in describing them. rompe (rm-pe-) is the usual word for year. Note: te.ke.rompe 
‘Next year’, t.n-.rompe ‘Annually’, rompe n-.br-re ‘New year’, rompe n-.ouwm ‘Alimony’ (lit. Year of food), rm-
p.4ire ‘Famine’ (lit. Year of little). Also note snou.3 ‘Last year’. sp--, sep-, is used in dating events only; e.g. 
t.sp-.sn-te ‘The second year’.
§132. The Month: ebot, pl ebate. The names of the months were:
1
 qoout
7
 parem6ot(p)
2
 paope (poope, paape)
8
 parmoute
3
 6aqwr

 kia6k (xoia6k)
10
 pawne
5
 twbe
11
 ephp (ephf)
6
 m4ir
12
 mesorh (meswrh)
§133. The Day: 6oou is the usual word; e.g. mn-.n-.sa soou n-.6oou ‘After six days’, 4a pe.6oou ‘Until the 
day’, etc. It is widely used in a number of adverbial phrases; e.g. m-.pe.6oou ‘By day’, n-.ou.6oou ‘On a day, 
one day’. Note: p.oou (for p.6oou) ‘Today’ in such phrases as m-.p.oou ‘Today’, 4a.p.oou ‘Until today’, 
`in.p.oou ‘Since today’. Note: p.oou n-.6oou ‘This day’. Note: mhne (always in the form m-.mhne) ‘Every day’. 
But when the day of a month or a festival is indicated, the form sou- (from shu ‘Time or season’) is used; e.g. 
n-.sou sa43 n-.qoout ‘On the seventh day of Thowt’; note that the Cardinal Numeral is used. With the 
18

--- Page 19 ---
numeral ‘One’ contraction takes place; e.g. n-.soua (for n-.sou.oua) m-.p.sabbaton ‘On the first day of the 
week’ (NB re Th 27), sou apa papnoute ‘The day (i.e. the festival) of Apa Papnoute’.
§134. Lesser divisions of time: nau ‘Hour, time’ (masc); cf the following compounds: nau n-.4wrp- 
‘Morning, early hour’, nau m-.meere ‘Midday’, nau n-.rou6e ‘Evening’; often in these compounds nou appears 
for nau. The following words are feminine in gender: ounou (pl ounooue) ‘Hour’ (note 2is.ounou ‘Half-hour’), 
6ote ‘Hour, moment’, `p-- (`ep-) ‘Hour’ (mostly with following numeral); e.g. m-.p.nau n-.`p.soe mn- `p-.yite ‘At 
the sixth hour and the ninth hour’ (Mt 20:5).
§135. Dating. The oldest documents were dated after the various occasions of the fixing of the tax 
assessment by the Roman authorities. From the time of Diocletian (297 AD), this tax assessment was made 
every 15 years. It is to be noted that it was customary to use the Greek numerals; e.g. n-.t.rompe ths 
tetarths indik(tionos), n-.ti.rompe oktohs ind(ikti) o(nos).
§136. But from the time of the Arab Conquest of Egypt (640 AD), the year was usually dated from ‘The year 
of Diocletian’ or ‘The year of the Martyrs’ which commenced the 29th of August 284 AD, a date which 
commemorated the most severe persecution of the Christian Church by the Roman authorities; e.g. etous 
diokl(htianos) basileus u\n\a\ ‘In the year of King Diocletian 451’. Later it was also customary to use the 
Mohammedan method of reckoning the year from the Hegira (16th July 622 AD); e.g. etous diokl(htianos) 
basileus u\n\a\ kai etous sarakoinon r\i\d\ ‘In the year of King Diocletian 451 and in the year of the 
Saracens 114’.
Chapter VI. The Verb.
§137. Coptic possesses two fundamental forms of the verb: Infinitive and Qualitative. With the help of the 
auxiliaries, all the necessary tenses of the verb can be formed from the Infinitive. The Qualitative is 
restricted in use to a few tenses only (§145). The Infinitive
 
  may be said to express a verbal action
 
 , which in 
Transitive Verbs passes to an object and in Intransitive Verbs affects the subject initiating the action. The 
Qualitative
 
  may be said to express the condition or state resulting from a verbal action
 
 .
§138. The Infinitive. In point of fact the Infinitive is a verbal noun and may show either a masculine or 
a feminine form, though syntactically it is always treated as a masculine substantive. As a general rule the 
masculine form ends in a consonant and favors an o sound for its formative vowel; e.g. bwl ‘To loose’, 
mou6 (for mw6, §14) ‘To fill’, swtm- ‘To hear’. Feminine forms end in e, and favor a or i as the formative 
vowel; e.g. mise ‘To give birth to’, ra4e ‘To rejoice’. But some infinitives ending in e are really masculine, 
their original final radical having fallen away; e.g. 4wpe ‘To become’ from original *hop‘r (curved underline); 
rw6e ‘To wash’ from original *roh‘t (curved underline).
§139. Meaning. The Infinitive can express an active or a passive sense (§259); e.g. ouwn ‘To open’ or 
‘To be opened’, tako ‘To destroy’ or ‘To be destroyed’, ta`ro ‘To make strong’ or ‘To be strengthened’. 
With Intransitive verbs the Infinitive expresses an action without a direct object, e.g. 6wn ‘To come near’; or 
it denotes the beginning of a condition or circumstance, e.g. 56e ‘To become drunken’.
§140. Forms. The Infinitive may have Absolute, Construct and Pronominal forms (§25); e.g. bwl, 
bel-, bol= ‘To loose’; solsl-, sl-sl--, sl-swl-= ‘To comfort’; thus:
 a.3.solsl-
‘He comforted’, or ‘He was comforted’
Absolute
 a.3.sl-sl-.pen.son
‘He comforted our brother’
Construct
 a.3.sl-swl-.s
‘He comforted her’
Pronominal
(for use of suffixes with the Pronominal form, §39-44)
Note: Not all verbs show the three forms; many possess only the Absolute form. This is particularly the case 
with the Intransitive verbs; e.g. rime ‘To weep’, mike ‘To rest’, br-br- ‘To boil’, etc.
§141. The Qualitative. The Qualitative originated from the Perfective form in Old Egyptian. In most verbs 
it has no special ending, being derived from the 3 masc sing of the Old Perfective that ended originally in 
the weak semi-consonant w, which was lost at an early period (in hieroglyphic texts it is more often omitted than 
written). Occasionally, however, the ending t is attached to the stem; e.g. smont Qualitative of smine ‘To 
establish’, `raeit (also `oor) Qual of `ro ‘To become strong’, tntont (also tntwn) Qual of tontn ‘To 
become like’. This ending, which is more often found in Bohairic, originated from the 3 fem sing of the Old 
Perfective -t’i. Note: Not all verbs have a Qualitative form; e.g. `nou ‘To ask’, `w ‘To say’, 4ipe ‘To be 
ashamed’, mou6 ‘To look’, etc. It would appear that many verbs which have no Qual had also lost the power 
to form Construct and Pronominal forms.
§142. A few verbs have lost all their forms with the exception of the Qualitative, which is then used as an 
19

--- Page 20 ---
Infinitive; e.g. a6e ‘To stand’, bost ‘To be dry’, kiwou ‘To be fat’, sht ‘To be fat’, s2ra6t ‘To rest’, 
4oueit ‘To be empty’, 6loulwou ‘To be high’, 6moos ‘To sit’, 6oou ‘To be putrid or wicked’, `oor(e) ‘To 
be strong’.
§143. Meaning. In contrast to the Infinitive, the Qualitative indicates the result of a verbal action, 
the effect or state produced by an action, the quality which it finally produces. In contrast to the Infinitive of 
Intransitive verbs, it suggests the permanent character of the verbal action effected. It might almost be said 
to suggest a neuter sense; e.g. tamio ‘To make’ Qual tamihu ‘To be created’, kmom ‘To become black’ 
Qual khm ‘To be black’.
§144. Note: nhu, which is employed as the Qual of ei ‘To come’, is commonly used to express a future 
sense ‘To be in the act of coming’; e.g. 3.nhu gar ebol n-.6ht.e n-2i ou.6hgoumenos ‘For a prince will come 
out of thee’ (lit. He is in the act of coming out of thee, namely a prince; Mt 2:6).
§145. As the Qualitative expresses the meaning of state or quality, it can with the relative particle 
supply the deficiency of adjectives in Coptic; e.g. nei+.tafos et.`h6 ‘These white-washed tombs’ (lit. 
These tombs which are smeared/whitened), p.p\n\a\ et.ouaab ‘The Holy Spirit’ (lit. The Spirit who [is] holy). In verbal 
sentences the Qual can only be used with the auxiliaries of I and II Present and Imperfect (§187.1). Note: In 
Crum's Coptic Dictionary, Qualitative forms are indicated by means of the dagger (†). In this grammar, the 
abbreviation Qual or Q is adopted to avoid confusion with the letter 5.
Chapter VII. Verb Classes 1.
§146. Verb Classes.
The system of classification of verbal stems adopted in this work is according to their consonantal and 
vocalic forms as shown in Sahidic. Reference to the older forms is only occasionally noted. The student is 
advised in the beginning to work at texts with the aid of Crum’s Coptic Dictionary, and to familiarize himself 
with the various verbal forms as they occur. Later he student can consult the etymologies given in 
Steindorff's, Koptische Grammatik, Sethe's Verbum, and Spiegelberg's Koptische Handwörterbuch. Note: 
The forms with a doubled vowel after the first consonant (baabe, moone, nhhbe, etc.) are especially confusing. 
Thus their Sahidic forms are in a section of their own (§170), although etymologically they are derived from 
various classes.
§147. The following abbreviations used in describing the verbal classes should be noted:

It is probable that all the verbs in this class were originally 3 lit, but contained a weak consonant which fell 
away at an early period. Evidence for this is forthcoming from the hieroglyphic forms of about 40 verbs 
which had become 2 lit in Coptic; e.g.

hkr
pwn

pnn

psš
It may be noted that, with the exception of Qual, the vocalization of the first syllable of 3 lit verbs is the 
same as 2 lit. The majority of the 2 lit verbs follow the model bwl exactly. Note: After m and n the formative 
vowel of the Absolute changes to ou (§14); e.g. mour ‘To bind’, nout ‘To grind’. Note: Before 6 and 4 
20

--- Page 21 ---
(representing old h [curved underline]), o of the Pronominal form changes to a (§15); e.g. ma6.ou for mou.ou 
‘To fill them’. Likewise pa6= ‘To break’, ta6= ‘To mix’, oua4= ‘To wish’, oua6= ‘To put’, `a6= ‘To smear’. 
An exception is 6w6 ‘To scratch’, which shows 6o6=.
§149. Some verbs, which in their Construct, Pronominal and Qual forms follow the model of 2 lit verbs, 
show in their Absolute Form an apparent 3 lit inf form; e.g. bwte ‘To pollute’ bet-, bot=, Q bht. Likewise 
bwke ‘To tan (leather)’, kwte ‘To turn’, lw2e ‘To hide’, nou6e ‘To shake’, nou`e ‘To throw’, swte ‘To 
redeem’, twpe ‘To taste’, w3e ‘To press’, 3wte ‘To wipe off’, 3w2e ‘To leap’, `wte ‘To pierce’, 2wpe ‘To 
seize’, 2w`e ‘To dig’. Note: pw2e ‘To break’ po2= but Qual po2e (as 3 lit inf form).

To this group belongs by far the largest number of verbs, over 200 in all. The few exceptions to this vocalic 
structure of 3 lit verbs of the pwr4- model need not occupy the student's attention. It is to be noted that the 
Pronominal and the Qualitative forms are identical. The Construct form is sometimes written with an e, but 
quite often without; e.g. tkm- and tekm- ‘To pluck’, 4tb- and 4etb- ‘To muzzle’.
§155. A few verbs ending in e are really 3 lit verbs like pwr4-, but have lost their final t, and in the case of 
4wpe a final r (original hpr [curved underline]). It is to be noted that in the two verbs which have Construct and

These forms are interesting in that they show an intermediate stage in the metamorphosis of a 3 lit verb into

regular 2 lit Qual 4ht.

Verbs with the formative vowel after the second radical in the Absolute Form are intransitive and show only 
Absolute and Qualitative forms. An exception is 6ro4 ‘To become heavy’, which is both transitive and 
intransitive in meaning. A Construct form to 6ro4 also occurs: 6(e)r4-. Verbs of this class with m or n as the 
first consonant show the forms:

m-ka6
‘To become painful’

has no Qual of its own; r4,
the Qual of wr4 ‘To be cold’, is used instead
Note the Qualitative forms of the following: ourot ‘To become glad’ Qual roout. 6ko ‘To become hungry’ 
shows two forms of the Qual (§141): 6okr (the old masc form in which the final weak consonant r reappears) and 
23

--- Page 24 ---
6kaeit or 6koeit (the fem form, which is more common than the masc in Sahidic). `ro ‘To become strong’ (which 
is both an intransitive and a transitive verb) shows Qual `raeit.
§158. Model 4lhl ‘To pray’. A few verbs, mostly intransitives, show only Absolute Forms with h as the 
formative vowel after the second consonant. It is probable that nearly all these verbs are loan words.

§160. A number of verbs show, like the model verb ou`ai+, the formative vowel a in the last syllable. These 
are snat ‘To fear’ and 4tam ‘To shut’ (Construct 4tam-). 4ta ‘To become faulty’, 6ra or 4ra ‘To drive, 
compel’ (absolute forms only), 4ma ‘To become lightweight or fine’ shows Qual 4oome. `na ‘To quench’ has 
forms `ne-, `na=; a pronominal form only `na= occurs with the meaning ‘To send’. Note: srit ‘To glean’ 
shows a pronominal form srat= (sometimes srit=).
§160a. Two common verbs have short o as their Formative Vowel after the first consonant. Both verbs 
originated from forms with a weak medial consonant, but unlike the majority of verbs which originated from 
similar consonantal forms, they have not become 2 lit (§148). The Qualitative form of the first of these two 
verbs shows this tendency at work:

Verbs of this model are the most common of the 3 lit inf verbs. Not only are they fem in their Absolute form, 
but they further show the old fem ending in t in the Construct and Pronominal forms. As a general rule, the 
Construct has e as the formative vowel, and a appears in the Pronominal. The Qual generally shows o as its 
characteristic vowel. Note: Before 6 and 4 (§15), o changes to a; e.g. 56e ‘To become drunken’ Qual ta6e, 
ei4e ‘To hang’ Qual a4e. However, site ‘To throw’ has Qual sht, and 6ioue ‘To strike’ Qual 6woui.

ouestwn.
§167. Model br-br- ‘To boil’ (note the presence of the sonant consonant). Verbs of this model are intransitive and

§171. Causative Verbs. Two formations of the Causative exist in Coptic: The first, and less common, 
by means of the prefix s-, and the second by means of the prefix t-. (a) Formation with prefix s-. This 
was the regular method of forming Causatives in Old Egyptian. In Coptic, however, only a few verbs form 
the Causative in this way. Here may be noted:

§172. In a few verbs with ` as the first consonant, the prefix s- changes to 4 (§11); e.g. from s `a`e
.
 to 
4a`e (Boh sa`i) ‘To speak’ (old sdd), 4o`ne (Boh so2ni) ‘To take counsel’ (old stn’i). Note: 4ouo ‘To empty’ 
4oue-, 4ouw= is a causative which has lost its prefix (old sšw).
§173. (b) Formation with prefix t-. This prefix is a contracted form of 5 ‘To give’. It is the normal 
method employed to form the causative. Addition of this prefix makes intransitive verbs transitive, and to 
transitive verbs it gives a causative meaning. All the verbs in this class follow a common formation with but 
minor variations; e.g.:
Absolute

Pronominal

t.saeie-
t.saeio=
t.sa(e)ihu
t.ou`o

t.ou`e-
t.ou`o=

Note: A few verbs show the feminine form of the Qual; e.g. t.akhut ‘Destroyed’, t.sabhut ‘Made wise’. 
Also a few verbs show Qual forms ending in -eit: q.msoeit ‘Made to sit’, k.toeit (also k.thu) ‘Made to 
turn’.
§174. The prefix t- before roots beginning with 6 and with their second consonant b, l or m, often coalesces 
with the 6 to become q:

One Causative sometimes shows the prefix and at other times omits it: (t.)sto ‘To bring back’: (t.)ste-, 
(t.)sto=, Q (t.)sthu.
§177. Compound Verbs. (Cf also §90) By means of a verb in the Construct form placed before a 
substantive, Coptic is able to form a very great number of Compound verbs; e.g.:
ka.moou
‘To cease to give water’
me6.moou
‘To draw (lit. to fill with) water’
r-.moou
‘To become water’
sek.moou
‘To draw water’
5.moou
‘To give water’
3i.moou
‘To carry water’
6i.moou
‘To rain’
`i.moou
‘To take water’
The principal verbs used in forming Compounds are:
r- (eire)
‘To do, make’
5- (5)
‘To give (actively)
e4 or 4-
‘To be able’
oue4- (ouw4)
‘To wish’
4p- (4wp)
‘To receive’
oue6- (ouw6)
‘To set’
4r-p (4wrp)
‘To do first’
3i- (3i)
‘To carry, bear’
6i- (6ioue)
‘To strike’
`i- (`i)
‘To take (passively)’
2n-- (2ine)
‘To find’
Note: `i.5
‘To buy and sell’
§178. Greek Verbs appear in the Active Imperative, a form identical with the Infinitive form minus the final 
ιν or σθαι; e.g.:
Coptic
Greek
sunage
συναγειν
pisteue
πιστευειν
6ubrice
υβριζειν
aisqane
αιθανεσθαι
epikalei
επιδαλεισθαι
Contracted Verbs omit the final ν:
Coptic
Greek
plana
πλαναν
kosmei
κοσµειν
aciou
αξιουν
Verbs in -µι are treated as Contracted Verbs:
Coptic

Chapter IX. Conjugation; Durative Tenses.
§180. In Old Egyptian the oldest method of conjugating the verb was by means of attaching the Suffix 
Pronouns to the Verbal Stem. As the language developed, a new method gradually arose in which 
conjugation was effected by means of auxiliary verbs— with suffixes attached— placed before the verbal 
stem. By the time that Coptic had replaced the older stage of the language, the Old Conjugation with the 
Suffix Pronouns had almost completely disappeared. The few surviving verbs are:
§181. (1) The verb `w ‘To say’, which is frequently used with auxiliaries, also shows a form pe`e- with 
Nominal Subjects and pe`a= with Pronominal Subjects (this form originated from an old relative form p3dd.f, ‘That 
which he says’); e.g. pe`e p.`oeis na.u ‘The Lord says to them’, pe`a.3 na.s ‘He says to her’. Note: 
(e)6ne-, (e)6na= ‘To be willing’; e.g. 5.na.4wwt na.k e6na.i+ ‘I shall sacrifice to thee (for) I am willing’ (Ps 
53:6); also mio= ‘To be hale’, expressing thanks or greeting; e.g. mio.k ‘Hail to thee!’
§182. (2) The adjective verbs:
Construct
Pronominal
Meaning
naa-
naa=
‘To be great’ (§183)
nanou-
nanou=
‘To be good’
nese-
nesw=
‘To be beautiful’
na4e-
na4w=
‘To be numerous’
ne2e-
ne2w=
‘To be hateful’
E.g. nanou.s na.n e2w m-.pei.ma ‘It is good for us to remain here’ (Mt 17:4), eis.6hhte nesw ta.4beere 
‘Behold, thou art beautiful, my daughter’ (S of S 1:15), mh n-to.k naa.k e.pen.eiwt iakwb ‘Art thou greater 
than our father Jacob?’ (Jn 4:12).
§183. Note: The idiomatic use of naa- in the compound naiat=, ‘  Blest’
 
 . This is a contracted form of 
naa.i+at, lit. ‘Great is the eye’. It is always followed by the Suffix Pronoun, which agrees with the subject in 
number and person; e.g. naiat.k- simwn bar iwna ‘Blest art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah’  (Mt 16:17), naiat.n- 
anon (m-).pen.ka6 ‘Blest are we in our land’ (Budge, Misc. 433.1). When the subject is in the 3rd person singular 
or plural, the noun is introduced by the particle n-; e.g. naiat.3- m-.p.rwme ‘Blest is the man’ (Ps 1:1), 
naiat.ou n-.n-.bal ‘Blest are the eyes’ (Lk 10:23, §94).
§184. (3) The impersonal existential verbs oun-  ‘T
  o be’
 
  and mn-  ‘N
  ot to be’
 
  with following nominal subject; 
e.g. oun- ou.4hre 4hm m-.pei.ma ‘There is a young child here’ (Jn 6:9), mn- agaqos n-.sa oua p.noute ‘There 
is none good except one, God’ (Mt 19:17). Note 1: 4-4e- (e44e-) ‘T
  o be befitting’
 
  and m4-4e- (me44e-) ‘T
  o   
be unbefitting’; e.g. tai gar te q.e et.e44e ero.n e`w.k ebol n-.dikaiosunh nim ‘For this is the way 
which is befitting for us to fulfill all righteousness’ (Mt 3:15), 44e a.r-.baptize 6m-    p.snau 6m- p.ouoein mn- 
p.moou ‘It is appropriate to be baptized in both, in the light as well as the water’ (Philip 81). Note 2: m-44e- 
seems to be confined to negating relative clauses. The negation of 4-4e- in statements and questions is 
effected by n- ... an (§195); e.g. n.e44e.2e n-to.k an ero.k pe ena.m-.pek.4b-r- 6m-6al ‘Is it not fitting for 
thee, even thou, to have pity upon thy fellow-servant?’ (Mt 18:33).
§185. Conjugation by means of Auxiliaries. By means of the Auxiliaries, Coptic is able to form all the 
tenses needed to express affirmative verbal action in past, present and future time. There are also four 
auxiliaries which can express negation, but these are confined to the Perfect, the Tense of Habit, a special 
29

--- Page 30 ---
form of the Future, and the tense of Unfulfilled Action. The tense or complete verbal group consists of 
three parts: (1) The auxiliary, (2) The subject (noun or pronoun), (3) The verbal form. E.g. 
a.p.rwme swtm- ‘The man heard’, a.3.swtm- ‘He heard’. Exceptions to this order are I Present (§189) and I 
Future (§209), in which the subject stands first without any preceding auxiliary; e.g. p.rwme swtm- ‘The man 
hears’, 3.swtm- ‘He hears’, p.rwme na.swtm- ‘The man will hear’, 3.na.swtm- ‘He will hear’.
§186. Forms of the Auxiliaries; First and Second Tenses. The most striking feature of Coptic is its 
possession of two forms of the Auxiliaries, distinguished by the names ‘First’ and ‘Second’ Tenses; e.g.:
 
I Tense
II Tense
Present
3.swtm-
e.3.swtm-
Perfect
a.3.swtm-
n-ta.3.swtm-
Habitude
4a.3.swtm-
e.4a.3.swtm-
Future
3.na.swtm-
e.3.na.swtm-
(a) The existence of two sets for each tense presupposes that each form possesses separate syntactical 
functions; for it is quite clear that II Tenses are by no means secondary or subordinate, in that they appear 
in main sentences, in independent statements, and in questions. By comparing Coptic translations with 
Greek originals, Dr H.J. Polotsky (Études de Syntaxe Copte, Cairo, 1944) has convincingly demonstrated that the 
use of II Tenses indicates that a special stress is to be expected on the Adverbial Extension. (But 
there are many examples in which II Tenses are used where no Adverbial Extension is present. It is doubtful 
whether all these exceptions to the general rule can be dismissed as improper uses.) The Adverbial 
Extension may be a real adverb (§281) or its equivalent, i.e. an adverbial phrase formed by means of a 
preposition followed by a noun or pronoun (§282ff); it may also include the Indirect Object or Dative 
introduced by n- (§263); or it may be an Adverbial Clause introduced by a conjunction (§369ff), or even direct 
speech introduced by the particle `e (in origin an infinitive introduced by a preposition rdd ‘To say’). (b) As in 
English, the normal position of emphasis is at the beginning of the sentence, except where vocal intonation 
indicates otherwise. In the written language, this position is important, since the eye is the sole guide to 
interpretation; e.g. ‘To you is this order given’, ‘Today I shall do this’, ‘Because you were absent, this 
happened to us’, ‘Come with me, said the man’, ‘Whither are you going?’, etc. However, Coptic preferred 
to keep its normal word order: auxiliary, subject, verbal form, object, indirect object or adverb 
(§318); departure from the normal stress was indicated at the beginning of the sentence by means 
of the Second Tenses; e.g.:
II Present, stress on:
na.k
p.6r-.4ire e.`w  m-mo.s  na.k  twoung-
‘Young man, to thee I say: Arise!‘ (Lk 7:14)
II Present, stress on:
Interrogative Adverb etwn
e.k.bhk  etwn
‘Whither art thou going?’ (Z 318.a.2.)
II Future, stress on:
the adverb m-mau
e.3.na.4wpe  m-mau  n-2i p.rime  mn-.p.2a26  n-.n-.ob6e
 ‘There the weeping and gnashing of teeth will happen.’ (Mt 
22:13)

§187. Durative and Limitative Tenses. The Narrative Tenses can be divided into two main groups. In this 
grammar the names Durative and Limitative are adopted. Under the group Durative appear the Present, 
Imperfect and Circumstantial. The name Durative is applied to these tenses in that they have no 
reference to a definite temporal standpoint. They represent an action or state which is in the process of 
being achieved; that is to say, they indicate a durative process without fixed limits in time. In contrast, the 
Limitative Tenses indicate a fixed standpoint in time: past, future or habitually repeated (§199). Two 
important facts about the Durative Tenses must be noted: (1) They alone can use the Qualitative. This is 
understandable when the essential nature of the Qualitative is considered (§143, 145). (2) They cannot 
take a Direct Object, i.e. the Construct and Pronominal forms of the Infinitive cannot be used. 
Thus, to say ‘I am saying it’, Coptic must write 5.`w m-mo.s. The form ‘5.`oo.s’ is impossible, though with 
the Limitative Tenses such a form is the normal usage; e.g. a.i.`oo.s ‘I said it’ (§328).

*NB: The II Present and Circumstantial Tenses have identical forms but differing functions; see §192n, 197.
§189. I Present. As the name suggests, the principle use of this tense is to express present time in 
narrative; e.g. pe.p\n\a\ ni3e e.p.ma et.3-.oua4.3- auw k-.swtm- e.te3.smh ‘The spirit (wind) blows to the 
place which it wishes, and thou art hearing its sound’ (Jn 3:8), t.mn-t.noute `oor e.6wb nim ‘Godliness is 
stronger than all things’ (Wisd 10:12), tenou tn-.eime `e k.sooun- n-.6wb nim ‘Now we perceive that thou art 
understanding everything’ (Jn 16:30).
§190. When the Nominal Subject is undefined or has the Indefinite Article, it must be introduced by the 
Impersonal verb oun-- (mn- in negation), §184; e.g. oun- ou.rwme nhu 6i.pa.6ou m-mo.i ‘There is a man 
coming after me’ (Jn 1:30), mn- sboui `ose e.pe3.sa6 ‘There is not (a) disciple higher than his teacher’ (Lk 
6:40).
§191. Besides its use in narrative, the I Present occurs: (a) in Oaths; e.g. 3.on6 n-2i p.`oeis ‘As the Lord 
liveth’ (Ruth 3:13, Z 292.a.8); (b) in Questions, (i) introduced by an Interrogative; e.g. etbe.ou te.rime 
‘Why dost thou (f.) weep?’ (Z 339.a.3), a6rw.tn- tetn-.4tr-twr ‘Why are you troubled?’ (Mk 5:39); and (ii) 
very often without an introductory Interrogative, the context alone indicating a question which would be 
expressed vocally by tone of voice; e.g. k.me m-mo.i e.6oue nai+ ‘Dost thou love me more than [you love] 
these?’ (Jn 21:15), k.ouw4 e.nau e.pe.x\s\ ‘Dost thou wish to see the Christ?’ (Z 306.b.1, §341ff).
§192. II Present. Like the I Present, this tense carries the sense of present action, but with the difference 
that the main stress in the sentence is laid on the Adverbial Extension (§186). Accordingly, this tense is 
widely used in Questions where the Interrogative does not stand at the beginning of the sentence; e.g. 
alla ere.pe3.ouw4 4oop 6m-.p.nomos m.p.`oeis ‘But in the law of the Lord is his desire’ (Ps 1:2), pe`a.3 
na.3 e.k.bhk etwn; pe`a.3 `e e.i.bhk e.5.meeue n-.ne.snhu ‘He says to them: Whither are you going? He 
says: To instruct the brothers am I going!’ (Z 318.a.2). Note: Though in Sahidic the forms of the II Present 
31

--- Page 32 ---
are the same as the Circumstantial, they must not be confused, for their syntactical functions are quite 
distinct from one another. Bohairic distinguishes between II Present and Circumstantial thus: II Present 
are-, a=; Circumstantial ere-, e=.
§193. Negation of the Present. There is no special Negative Auxiliary; negation is effected by means of 
the particles n- ... an:
§193a. Negation of I Present; e.g. n-.tetn-.soon an m-.pe.6oou oude te.unou ‘You are not knowing the 
day or the hour’ (Mt 25:13), n-.t.me 4oop an 6rai+ n-.6ht.n- ‘The truth is not existing in us’ (I-Jn 1:8). Note 1: n- 
before p becomes m- (§10); e.g. m-.pe3.bios eine an m-.pa.ouon nim ‘His life does not resemble that of 
everyone’ (Wisd 2:15). And when followed by k, 3 or s, the negative appears as n.g- (§2n), n.3-, n.s-; e.g. p.soi 
de et.6m-.pek.bal n  .  g  -.nau ero.s an ‘The beam which is in thine eye, thou dost not see it’ (Mt 7:3), n  .  3  -.swtm- 
an ‘He does not hear’. Note 2: n- is not infrequently omitted before I Present; e.g. 5.o an n-.q.e 
m-.p.ke.seeme n-.n-.rwme ‘I am not become as the rest of men’ (Lk 18:11), nek.maqhths de se.nhsteue an 
‘But thy disciples, they do not fast’ (Mk 2:18).
§193b. Negation of II Present; e.g. n-.ei.sops an de e.k.e3it.ou ebol 6m-.p.kosmos ‘That thou mayest 
take them out of the world, I am not asking (of Thee)’ (Jn 17:15), n-.e.re.nai+ gar ta6e an n-.q.e n-.twtn- 
e.tetn-.meeue ero.s ‘In the way which you are thinking, these (men) are not drunken’ (Acts 2:15).
§194. The Imperfect. Though this tense is designated ‘Imperfect’ in Coptic grammatical treatises, it must 
not be regarded as the equivalent of the Greek Imperfect. It might more exactly be compared to the English 
Historic or Graphic Present. Its function as a tense is to describe a durative action or state which is now 
regarded as having been completed. Thus 3.swtm- = ‘He is hearing’, but ne.3.swtm- = ‘Was (i.e., now 
completed) he is hearing’ = ‘He was hearing’; e.g. nere.p.mhh4e thr.3 m-.p.laos 4lhl ‘The whole concourse 
of the people were praying’ (Lk 1:10), nere.i\s\ de me m-.marqa ‘But Jesus was loving Martha’ (Jn 11:5), 
ne.u.`wrm- de oube.pe3.eiwt ‘But they were beckoning to his father’ (Lk 1:62), ne.u.4oop gar 6n-.ou.mn-
t.`a`e mn- neu.erhu ‘For they were in enmity with one another’ (Lk 23:12).
§195. Sometimes the Existential Particle pe appears after the verbal form; e.g. nere.ne3.eiote de bhk 
pe tr-.rompe e.q.ilh\m\ ‘His parents were going every year to Jerusalem’ (Lk 2:41), ne.3.6ate pe n-.q.e n-.sa3 
‘It (the river) was flowing in the manner of yesterday’ (Josh 4:18). Note: As in the case of the Present (§190), 
when the Nominal Subject is undefined or has the Indefinite Article, the Impersonal Verb must be used, e.g. 
ne.un- (for ne.oun-) ou.bl-le pe 6moos 6atn-.te.6ih ‘There was a blind man sitting by the road’ (Lk 18:35).
§196. Negation of the Imperfect. As in the Present, Negation of the Imperfect is effected by means of n- 
... an; e.g. n-.ne.3.ouw4 gar an pe e.moo4e 6n-.5.oudaia ‘For he was not wishing to walk in Judaea’ (Jn 
7:1). But as a rule the first particle n- is omitted (§12); e.g. nere.ne.3.ke.snhu gar pisteue an ero.3 ‘He 
was not understanding’ (Jn 2:9).
§197. The Circumstantial. As has been noted (§192n), in formation this tense is the same as II Present. 
There is also a Future Circumstantial form which is similar to the II Future (§212). It is used in dependent 
clauses to amplify the main sentence. Strictly speaking, the Circumstantial has no tense. In both Greek and 
English it would correspond to a participle or a temporal sentence introduced by ‘While’ or ‘As’; e.g. a.3.`e 
nai+ e.3.4lhl ‘He said this (while) praying’ (Lk 18:11), ne.i+.moos m-.mhne pe 6m- pe.rpe e.i.5.sbw ‘I was 
sitting daily in the temple teaching’ (Mt 26:55). The Circumstantial clause may precede the main sentence; 
e.g. e.3.6moos 6n- te3.ri a.u.ouwn4 (for a.ou.ouwn4, §16) ei e.6oun 4aro.3 ‘As he was sitting in his cell, 
a wolf came to him’ (Z 334.b.4).
§197a. The Circumstantial is used after verbs expressing cessation, sentient perception and the like, to 
introduce a second verb which is usually expressed in English by a participle or an infinitive; e.g. a.s.lo 
e.s.4a`e nm-ma.s e.pei+.6wb ‘She ceased to speak with her about this matter’ (Ruth 1:18), a.3.nau e.pe.p\n\a\ 
m-.p.noute e.3.nhu e.pe.sht ‘He saw the Spirit of God coming down’ (Mt 3:16), a.3.6e ero.ou e.u.n-kotk 
‘He found them sleeping’ (Mt 26:40). Note: Before a Nominal Subject, the auxiliary appears in two forms, 
ere- or e-. As a general rule ere- is used in verbal sentences, e.g. ere.n-.ro 4otm ‘The doors being shut’ 
(Jn 20:19); and in Non-Verbal sentences with Adverbial Predicate, e.g. m-p.r-.`e.pai+ e.laau ere.p.6l-lo 
6m-.p.swma ‘Do not tell this to anyone while the old man is in the body (i.e. while he lives)’ (Z 342.a.7). e- is 
used in Non-Verbal sentences with Nominal Predicate in which the subject is either the 1st or 2nd Person 
Pronoun, or the 3rd Person represented by the Existential Particle pe, te or ne; e.g. e.ang- ou.s6ime 
n-.samariths ‘I being a woman of Samaria’ (Jn 4:9), naiat.3- m-.p.rwme e.p.ran m-.p.`oeis pe te3.6elpis 
‘Blessed is the man while his hope is in the name of the Lord’.
§198. Negation of Circumstantial. This follows the model of Negation of the Present, the only difference 
being that the verbal prefix e- precedes the negative particle n-; e.g. a.3.ei gar n-2i i+w6annhs e  .  n-  .  3.ouwn 
an oude e  .  n-  .  3.sw an ‘For John came neither eating or drinking’ (Mt 11:19).

Chapter X. Limitative Tenses.
§199. Under the term ‘Limitative’ are grouped all those tenses which have a definite standpoint 
in time, as opposed to the relatively timeless notion implied by the Durative tenses. The term ‘Limitative’ is 
here used to stress the fact that the verbal action is limited to a specific point in time. The action can be 
regarded as achieved in the past, or so certain of achievement that it can be regarded as completed in the 
future. Under ‘Limitative’ are included the following: The Perfect (§200ff), the Tense of Habitude (§204ff), the 
Future (§208ff) including the Optative (§220) and the two tenses of Unfulfilled Action (§223-24). Note that, in 
contrast to the Durative Tenses (§187.1), those tenses classed as Limitative cannot use the 
Qualitative form of the verb, but can use the Construct and Pronominal forms of the verb where 
they exist (cf further §326); e.g. a.3.`oo.s ‘He said it’, a.tek.m-na `pe mhte n-.m-na ‘Thy mina has produced 
ten mina’ (Lk 19:16), 5.na.`eu pa.aggelos ‘I will send my messenger’ (Mk 1:2.

§200. I Perfect. This is the historic tense indicating an action which has been completed in the past. In 
contrast to the Durative notion of the Imperfect, this tense represents Instantaneous Past Action; e.g. 
a.pe.farisaios de a6.erat.3- a.3.`e.nai+ ‘The Pharisee stood; he said this’ (Lk 18:11), a.u.5 n-.apot n-.hrp 
n-.ou.6l-lo ‘They gave a cup of wine to an old man’ (Z 291.d.1). Note: When a- stands before a Nominal 
Subject with the Indefinite Article, contraction usually occurs (§16); e.g. a.u.4a (for a.ou.4a) de 4wpe 
33

--- Page 34 ---
n-.ouoei4 ‘A feast once took place in Shiët (Z 291.d.1).
§201. Negation of I Perfect: e.g. m-pe.rwme 4a`e ene6 n-.q.e m-.pei+.rwme ‘Man did not ever speak as 
this man’ (Jn 7:46), auw on m-pe.p.6l-lo toloma e.tn-noou m-.p.maqhths ‘And still the old man dared not 
send the disciple’ (Z 294.c.6), etbe.ou m-p.ou.5.pei.so2n ebol 6a 4m-t.4e n-.sateere ‘Why did they not 
sell this ointment for 300 staters?’ (Jn 12:5). Note 1: The 1st pers sing sometimes appears in the form m-p.i-; 
the fuller forms m-pe.k-, m-pe.3-, and m-pe.s- are also common; e.g. m-pe.s.mise ‘She did not give birth’ (Z 
296.14). Note 2: m-pe- as a bad spelling for e.m-pe- with the meaning ‘Until’ (§231).
§202. II Perfect. This tense, while expressing instantaneous Past action, indicates that the main stress in 
the sentence is placed on the Adverbial Extension; e.g. n-ta.u.ei gar e.m4t p.ka6 ‘For to spy out the land 
have they come’ (Josh 2:3), n-ta.3.ouon6.3- de ebol n-.tei.6e ‘In this way he revealed himself’ (Jn 21:1), n-
ta.nai+ gar 4wpe `ekas ere.te.grafh `wk ebol ‘In order that the scripture should be fulfilled, these 
things happened’ (Jn 19:36); cf also the 3rd example, §186.
§203. Negation of II Perfect. Negation of this tense follows the model of II Present (§193), but it is to be 
noted that the first negative particle n- falls away before the initial n- of the auxiliary (it may be noted here that n- 
is similarly dropped with the II tenses of Habitude [§207] and Future [§213]); e.g. n-ta.i+.ei gar an `e e.i+e.krine 
m-.p.kosmos ‘For in order that I should judge the world I have not come’ (Jn 12:47), anok n-ta.4a`e an 
6aro.i+ mauaa.t ‘In respect of myself I have not spoken’ (Jn 12:49).
§204. Tense of Habitude. This tense, which has the distinctive syllable 4a, has the meaning of repeated 
instantaneous action. Customary action is indicated, but it is to be noted that a series of reiterated actions 
may not only be regarded as effected in the past, but also due to be effected in the future. This tense has 
been named, somewhat misleadingly, Praesens Consuetudinus; but the basic notion of a repetition of Past 
Action demands the relinquishing of the term Praesens at least.
§204a. I Habitude: e.g. 4are.peu.p\n\a\ ei ebol ‘Their spirit is wont to come forth’ (Ps 104:29?), 
4are.ni.4a`e e.q.oou take ni.6ht et.nanou.ou ‘Evil words will go on destroying good hearts’ (I-Cor 
15:33), e.u.4an.56e 4a.3.ka pet.2o`b ‘When they become drunken, he will go on putting forth that which 
is defective’ (Jn 2:10), 4a.3.swlp n-.n-.6alusis ‘He was wont to break the chains’ (Mk 5:4).
§205. Negation of I Habitude: e.g. mere.pe.tn-.sa6 5 te3.kite ‘Your master is not wont to pay his 
tribute’ (Mt 17:24), me.u.`ere ou.6hbs ‘They do not go on lighting a lamp’ (Mt 5:15).
§206. II Habitude. This tense expresses the notion of repeated instantaneous action, the main stress in 
the sentence being laid on the Adverbial Extension; e.g. e.4are.p.rwme n-.agaqos taue.agaqon ebol 
6m-.pa6o m-.pe3.6nt et.nanou.3 ‘Out of the treasure of his good heart the good man is wont to send out 
goodness’ (Lk 6:45), e.4a.3.ka p.hrp e.6rai+ et.nanou.3 n-.4orp ‘First of all he is wont to put out the good 
wine’ (Jn 2:10).
§207. Negation of II Habitude. Negation of this tense is effected by means of the particle an (§203); e.g. 
mh e.4a.3 `oo.s an na.3 `e sobte m-pe.5.na.ouom.3 ‘Prepare that which I shall eat!, is he not wont to say 
to him?’ (Lk 17:8): stress laid upon direct speech introduced by `e.
§208. Future Tenses. All the Future tenses, including the Optative and the two tenses of unfulfilled action 
(§222ff), originated from compound forms. Thus in I and II Future the distinctive syllable na is the final form 
of the old verb n‘i’, ‘To go’. The I Future probably sprang from a form *mn‘i’r, ‘To be going to’; the 
fundamental meaning of such a form as 5.na.swtm would therefore seem to be ‘I am to be going to hear’. 
Similarly the III Future can be traced back to the old compound ’iw+subject+r+infinitive; thus e.3.e.swtm 
originated from ’iw.fr.sdm, ‘He is to hear’. In this compound form, the preposition r (Coptic e-, ero=) had a 
strong implication of futurity. However, it should be noted that with the possible exception of the Future 
Imperfect, the verbal action is regarded as instantaneous, and not as durative. It is as if the action 
was regarded as so certain of achievement that already, in the speaker's mind, it was visualized as 
completed.
§209. I Future. This tense is used in statements and in questions introduced by an interrogative. It is to be 
noted that, as is the case with I Present, when the Subject is Nominal it stands first in the sentence without 
any preceding auxiliary; e.g. nei.wne na.4kak ebol ‘These stones will cry out’ (Lk 19:20), t.pe mn- p.ka6 
na.sine ‘Heaven and earth will pass away’ (Lk 21:33), se.na.2p-.thutn- ‘They will arrest you’ (Lk 21:12), 
etbe.ou k.na.ouon6.k- na.n ebol ‘Why wilt thou reveal thyself to us?’ (Jn 14:22), na4 n-.6e k.na.`oo.s 
m-.pek.son ‘How wilt thou say to thy brother?’ (Lk 6:42). Note 1: When the Nominal Subject is undefined or 
has the Indefinite Article, it must be introduced by oun-, (m-)mn-- in negation (§190); e.g. oun-.6a6 gar 
na.`oo.s na.i+ ‘For many will say to me’ (Mt 7:22), m-mn-.laau na.3i pe.tn-.ra4e ‘No one will take away your 
joy’ (Jn 16:22). Note 2: The 2 fem sing sometimes shows the form te.ra. The 1st and 2nd pl forms frequently 
appear as t-.na and tet.n-a (§12).
34

--- Page 35 ---
§210. The verb `pi- or `pe- preceded by I Future and followed by another verb, conveys the meaning 
‘Must’; e.g. p.4hre m-.p.rwme na.`pe.4p-.6a6 n-.6ise ‘The Son of Man must suffer many (things)’ (Mk 8:31), 
5.na.`pe.bwk ebol e.nau ero.s ‘I must go to see it’ (Lk 14:18).
§211. II Future. This tense expresses the Future, the main stress of the sentence being placed on the 
Adverbial Extension. It is especially used in Questions in which the Interrogative cannot stand at the head of 
the sentence; e.g. mh ere p.`oeis na.kaa.n n-sw.3 4a.ene6 ‘Will the Lord forever forsake us?’ (Ps 76:7), 
e.u.na.r-.q.e m-.p.4oei4 ‘As the dust will they be’ (Ps 1:4), e.i.na.r-.ou ‘What shall I do?’ (Lk 20:13). Note: 
The 2nd pl form alternates between e.tetn-.na and e.tet.n-a (§12).
§212. Future Circumstantial. As has been noted (§192n, 197), in Sahidic this tense is the same as the II 
Future in formation, although syntactically it functions quite differently; e.g. n-to.k de e.k.na.4lhl bwk 
e.6oun e.pek.tamion ‘But thou, as thou art about to pray, go into thy chamber’ (Mt 6:6), e.u.na.`i 
paulos de e.6oun e.t.parembolh pe`a.3 m-.p.xiliarxos ‘As Paul was about to be taken into the camp, 
he said to the Chiliarch’ (Acts 21:37). (Bohairic distinguishes between II Future and Future Circumstantial: II Fut are – 
na, a= – na; Fut Circum ere – na, e= – na.)
§213. Negation of I and II Future. Negation is effected by means of the particles n- ... an; e.g. 
n-.tn-.na.ouem laau an ‘We shall not eat anything’ (Z 346.b.10), m-.pa.6ht na.r-.6ote an ‘My heart will not 
fear’ (Ps 26:3). But frequently the particle n- is omitted before I Future, e.g. 5.na.twoun- an ‘I shall not rise 
up’ (Z 326.b.7); and almost always before II Future (§203), e.g. ere.p.rwme na.wn6 an e.oeik m-.mate ‘Not 
by bread only will men live’ (Mt 4:4).
§214. Future Imperfect. This tense conveys the notion of future action conceived in the past, an 
action which from the speaker's point of view has now been completed, although originally it was declared 
with reference to the future. Thus the meaning might be conveyed by the phrase ‘X was on the point of 
doing something’ or ‘X was about to do something’. A free rendering of such a form as ne.3.na.swtm- might 
be ‘He would hear’; e.g. nere.p.kosmos na.mere pete.pw.3 pe ‘The world would love that which is its own’ 
(Jn 15:19), nere.p.`oi gar na.4ouo 6m-.t.ma et.m-mau ‘For the ship was about to discharge its cargo in that 
place’ (Acts 21:3), ne.3.na.mou gar pe ‘For he was on the point of dying’ (Jn 4:47). Note: As in the case of 
the Imperfect (§195), the Existential Particle pe often appears after the verbal form; cf the first and third of 
the aforementioned examples.
§215. Negation of Future Imperfect. Negation is effected by means of the Negative Particles n- ... an; e.g. 
n-.ne.3.na.swtm an ‘He was not about to hear’. More often n- is omitted; e.g. nere.pa.son na.mou an pe ‘My 
brother would not have died’ (Jn 11:32). It may be noted that examples of Negation of Future Imperfect are 
not common.
[MS lacks §216.]
§217. III Future (Energetic). This tense lays special stress on the achievement of an action in the future. 
It carries a much stronger notion of futurity than the I Future, and is commonly found in commands, 
strong wishes and in Final Clauses introduced by `e or `eka(a)s (cf the last example in §186); 
e.k.e.tai+e pek.eiwt ‘Thou shalt honor thy father’ (Mt 19:19), pe`a.3 n-.ne3.`aio6s `e p.`oeis 
e.3.e.4wpe nm-mh.tn- pe`a.u na.3 `e ere.p.`oeis smou ero.k ‘He says to his harvesters: May the Lord be 
with you!; they say to him: May the Lord bless thee!’ (Ru 2:4). Note: When the Subject is Nominal, and in 
view of the origin of this tense (§208), one would expect the construction: ere.p.rwme e.swtm ‘The man 
shall hear’ or ‘May the man hear’. In practice, however, the e (representing the old r) falls away, so leaving the 
construction ere.p.rwme swtm, a form identical to II Present. The second example quoted above indicates 
a case in which the context shows that III Future is to be understood, and the same example also shows the 
marked preference in Coptic for the use of the suffix forms of the auxiliaries even when the subject is 
nominal (cf further §322); e.g. ere.p.rwme e.swtm ‘The man will hear’ or ‘May the man hear’.
§218. Negation of III Future; e.g. n-ne.u (for n-ne.ou, §16).alektwr moute ‘A cock shall not crow’ (Jn 
13:38), n-ne.k.6wtb ‘Thou shalt not kill’ (Mt 19:18), m-p.r.kr-ine `e n-.neu.krine m-mw.tn- ‘Do not judge, in 
order that they shall not judge you’ (Lk 6:37).
§219. IV Future (Finalis). The use of this tense is confined to direct speech, either real or fictitious. For 
the most part it follows an Imperative, and signifies the result which should follow when the action of the 
Imperative has been achieved. Preceded by a Question, it indicates the result which should happen if the 
course of action postulated by the questioner is carried out. Though as a rule this tense conveys a Final 
meaning, sometimes more than the result of action prescribed or avoided is implied. In some cases there is 
the implication of intention, either on the part of the speaker or by some third party alluded to by the 
speaker— cp the idiomatic use of ‘Shall’ and ‘Will’ in English; e.g. swtm ero.i+ tare.tetn.yuxn wn6 ‘Hear 
me (and) your soul shall live’ (Isa 55:3), au eis p.n-ta.3.meut p.3-.son tar.n-.moout.3- ‘Bring out him who 
has slain his brother (and) we will kill him’ (II-Sam 14:7), n-tok pet.nhu `n- tar.n-.2w4t 6ht.3- n-.ke.oua ‘Art 
35

--- Page 36 ---
thou he who is coming, or do we look for another?’ (Mt 11:3), n-ne.u.ket tei.kuph 6m-.pa.ouoei4 
tare.t.oikoumenh thr.s eime `e aukhph [sic] 6e 6n-.4iht etbe ou.apot n-.hrp ‘This dome shall not be 
built in my time, so that the whole world shall see that a dome fell in Shiet because of a cup of wine’ (Z 
292.a.8). Note: 1st pres sing is replaced by auw and I Future, or by the Conjunctive.
§220. The Optative. This tense expresses the notion of a wish, a hope or a request, which may or may 
not be fulfilled in the future; e.g. mare.pek.ran ouop ‘May thy name be hallowed’ (Mt 6:9), mare.s.4wpe 
ne n-.q.e et.e.oua4.s ‘May it happen to thee as thou wishest’ (Mt 15:28), mare.mari6am ei ebol n-.6ht.n- 
‘Let Mariam go out from among us!’ (Thomas 114). Note: An old Absolute Form maro.n ‘L
  et us!’
 
  still exists in 
Coptic. This form is used, without any following Infinitive, to express the meaning ‘Let us go!’; e.g. alla 
maro.n 4aro.3 ‘Let us go to him’ (Jn 11:15), toun-.thutn- maro.n ebol 6m-.pei+.ma ‘Rise, let us go from this 
place’ (Jn 14:31).
§221. Negation of the Optative. Negation is effected by means of a compound form m-p.r--. This 
compound is formed by the negative of the Imperative (§242) and the Causative Infinitive (§243); e.g.
m-p.r-.tre.3.swtm ‘Do not cause him to hear’, m-p.r-.tre.laau eime ‘Do not let anyone perceive’ (Mt 9:30),
m-p.r-.tre.n.moo4e 6n- te.6ih m-.p.r-ro ‘Let us not proceed by the King's Highway’ (Mon 587.f.98n).

§223. Model 4ant.3-.swtm- ‘Until he hears’. This auxiliary, originating from the old r sdmt.f, later replaced 
by the more forceful š3‘i’.f sdm, has the meaning ‘Until’. In the other dialects, and in the oldest form of 
Sahidic, this auxiliary appears in the form 4ate.3.swtm-. The n which appears in the Sahidic form is 
probably due to some contamination of 4ate.3.swtm- with the Conjunctive n-te.3.swtm- (§225)— with 
which, however, it has no affinity; e.g. a.u.`ioor ... 4ante.p.laos thr.3- `ioor m-.p.iordanhs ‘They 
crossed over ... until all of the people (had) crossed over the Jordan’ (Josh 3:17), ari.6wb 4an.5.ei ‘Work 
until I come’ (Lk 19:13). Note: In the 1st pers sing 4an.5- is more frequently found than 4an.ta-.
§224. Model m-pat.3-.swtm- ‘Before he hears’. This auxiliary, which originated from the old compound form 
bw ’ir.tn-f sdm, has the meaning of action which has not yet been effected, but which is due to be effected 
in the future. It may be translated by ‘Not yet’ or ‘Before’; e.g. m-pate.ta.ounou ei ‘My hour has not yet 
come.’ (Jn 2:4), amou e.p.esht m-pate.pa.4hre mou ‘Come down before my son dies’ (Jn 4:49), m-
pa.5.4wpe m-.monaxhs ‘I have not yet become a monk’ (Z 384.a.1).

(The forms in square brackets are the Bohairic forms, which preserved the t throughout.) The alternate forms of the 
3rd pers masc and fem sing are only occasionally found, being liable to be confused with the Imperfect forms. 
On the whole, ta is more common than n-ta for 1st pers sing.
§226. Uses of the Conjunctive. The chief function of this auxiliary is to join together sentences, the 
tense of the verb in the opening sentence being continued in the sentence introduced by the Conjunctive. 
36

--- Page 37 ---
This tense is most frequently found after a sentence containing an Imperative. It is also used very frequently 
after a Future Tense. Though strictly speaking the Conjunctive has no tense of its own, depending upon a 
previous auxiliary for its time standpoint, yet on the whole it may be said that it implies the sense of action 
still to be achieved. Only very infrequently does it appear after the Past Tense, and then not as a simple 
continuation of the previous tense, but with a final meaning to express the object of an order. (a) After the 
Imperative: e.g. amhei.tn- n-.tetn-.ouwm ‘Come and eat’ (Jn 21:12), 6moos 6n-.tek.ri n.g-.rime ‘Sit in thy 
cell and weep’ (Z 347.21). (b) After the Future: e.g. p.rime na.4wpe e.rou6e nte.p.telhl 4wpe 
e.6tooue ‘Weeping will happen at evening, and joy will happen in (the) morning’ (Ps 30:5), k.na.per4 
nek.2i` ebol n-te.keoua mor.k- ‘Thou wilt stretch out thy hands, and another will gird thee’ (Jn 21:18), 
5.na.`w ta.yallei e.p.`oeis ‘I will sing and praise the Lord’ (Ps 26:6). (c) After the Past: e.g. p.douc de 
a.3.keleue n-se.talo.ou e.p.6ermhtarion ‘The governor ordered them to lift them on to the rack.’ (Mor. 
587.f.101.v), etbe.ou m-p.ou.5 pei+.so2n ebol 6a 4m-t.4e n-.sateere n-se.ta.ou n-.n-.6hke ‘Why did they 
not sell this ointment for 500 staters in order to give them to the poor?’ (Jn 12:5). Note: It must not be 
thought that the Conjunctive only follows the above mentioned tenses. It is found after the Present, 
Habitude, Optative, Causative Infinitive, Conditional Clause, Temporal Clause, etc. But its use after 
Imperative and Future is so common that the more regular use is here indicated instead of quoting all the 
less frequent uses. The use of this auxiliary after the Past, though comparatively rare, is noted in that the 
sense implied by its use is not merely continuity of the previous action.
§227. The Conjunctive is frequently used after verbs of wishing, commanding and allowing; e.g. 
keleue na.i ta.4a`e ‘Order me and I will speak’ (Pistis Sophia 202), ka nai+ thr.ou n-.se.bwk ‘Allow all 
these to go’ (Jn 18:8), k-.ouw4 ebw.k n.g-.moute e.pet.diakonei na.n ‘Dost thou wish to go and to call 
him who ministers to us?’ (Z 294.c.5).
§228. The Conjunctive sometimes appears in direct speech without an introductory verb. The reason for this 
is not clear. Perhaps in such cases a verb of wishing, commanding or requesting is mentally understood; e.g. 
pe`e.pilatos na.u `e ta.s5rou m-.petn-.r-ro ‘Pilate says to them: (Do you wish that) I crucify your king?’ 
(Jn 19:15), pe`e 6rouq t.mwabiths n-.noemein `e ta.bwk ebol e.t.sw4e ‘Ruth the Moabitess says to 
Naomi: (Let me) go to the field’ (Ruth 2:2).
§229. The Conjunctive is used after a number of Greek Conjunctions:
6wste
‘So that’
6opws
‘In order that’
mhpws
‘Lest in any way’
mhpote
‘For fear lest’
eimht(e)i
‘Unless’ 
E.g. kalws 6wb nim a.3.aa.u 6wste n.3-.tre.n-.al swtm- auw n.3-.tre.n-.ke.m-po 4a`e ‘He has done 
everything well, so that he has caused the deaf to hear and has caused the dumb also to speak’ (Mk 7:37), 
5.r-.6ote gar `e mhpote ta.ei 4arw.tn- ta.6e erw.tn- n-.q.e en.5.oua4 an ‘For I fear lest I come to you 
and find you in the way which I do not wish’ (II-Cor 12:20), eimhti n-.tn-.bwk anon n-.tn-.4wp ‘Unless we go 
and buy’ (Lk 9:13).
§230. Negation of the Conjunctive. Negation of the Conjunctive is effected by the negative particle tm-- 
being placed before the Infinitive; e.g. tet.na.4ine n-sw.i+ n-.tetn-.tm-.6e eroi+ ‘You will seek for me, and 
you will not find me’ (Jn 7:34), etbe.ou k.na.ouon6.k- na.n ebol n.g-.tm-.ouon6.k- m-.p.kosmos ‘Why wilt 
thou reveal thyself to us, and not reveal thyself to the world?’ (Jn 14:22).
§231. Compound Tenses with e- and ne-
To a number of Auxiliaries can be prefixed the verbal forms e- and ne- to form compound verbal structures; 
for example:
e.a.3.swtm-
e.m-p.3-.swtm-
e.m-pat.3.swtm-
e.me.3.swtm-
ne.a.3.swtm-
ne.4a.3.swtm-
ne.m-pat.3.swtm-
37

--- Page 38 ---
(a) e- precedes the auxiliary when it is used in a subordinate or co-ordinate sentence with past time 
meaning; e.g. n-tere.p.arxitriklinos de twpe m-.p.moou e.a.3.r-.hrp ‘When the ruler of the feast had 
tasted the water after it became wine’ (Jn 2:9). Note 1: It is possible, as Dr. H.J. Polotsky has pointed out 
(Étude de Syntaxe Copte, p.49), that in some cases e.g. e.a.3.swtm- has been employed as a II Perfect tense. 
(b) e- prefixed to the negation of the I Perfect renders ‘U
  ntil’
 
 ; e.g. n-.ne.tei+.genea ou.eine e.m-p.ou.4wpe 
‘This generation shall not pass away until they have occurred’ (Lk 21:32). Note 2: m-p.3-- and m-pat.3-- 
sometimes are found as bad spellings for e.m-p.3-- and e.m-pat.3--. (c) ne- prefixed to past tenses gives a 
Pluperfect meaning (originating from the old wn ‘To exist’, §194); e.g. ne.a.u.ei pe ‘When they had come’ (Jn 
11:19), ne.4are.p.6hgemwn ka.oua ebol ‘The governor had been accustomed to release one’ (Mt 27:15), 
ne.m-pat.ou.soun- te.grafh ‘They had not yet understood the Scripture’ (Jn 20:9); cf also §233n.
§232. Impersonal Verbs. When verbs are used impersonally, the 3rd pers fem sing -s is generally used; 
e.g. a.s.4wpe ‘It happened’. But occasionally the 3rd masc -3 is used; e.g. 3-.sh6 ‘It is written (as follows)’. 
There are, however, a small number of verbs which are impersonal; the most important of these are:
ouon, (oun--)
 ‘To be’, and its negative: 
m-mon ([m-]mn--) (§233)
4-4e-
 ‘To be befitting or appropriate’ (§184.1)
6aps
 ‘To be needful’ (§237)
6w
 ‘To be enough’ (§237a)
§233. ouon, oun-- ‘There is/are’ (Existential) and m-mon, (m-)mn-- ‘There is/are not’ (Neg Existential):
(1) The Construct forms are far more common than the Absolute forms, and are used in a Verbal Sentence 
employing one of the Durative tenses when the subject is undefined or has only the Indefinite Article (§190, 
195) or the I Future (§209.1). (2) In the Non-Verbal sentence (§314); e.g. oun-.ou.4hre 4hm m-.pei+.ma ‘There 
is a young boy here’ (Jn 6:9), mn- agaqos n-.sa oua p.noute ‘There is not (anyone) good except one, God’ 
(Mt 19:17). Note: The past tense is formed by means of ne- (§231); e.g. ne.oun- oua 6n-.khme ‘There was 
one in Egypt’ (Z 338.c.1), ne.mn-.pet.bohqei ero.ou ‘There was not a helper for them’ (Ps 107:12). 
Frequently ne.oun- contracts to ne.un-; e.g. ne.un-.ou.rwme de n-.rm-.mao ‘There was a rich man’ (Lk 16:19).
§234. (3) Possession: In the forms:
Possession
old form
Affirmative: 
oun-te-, oun-te=, oun-ta=
wn md’i
Negative: 
mn-te-, mn-te=, mn-ta=
nn wn  md’i
—literally, ‘There exists in the hand of’, ‘There exists not in the hand of’; by which forms Coptic conveys the 
notion of possession or the lack of possession. Thus in order to say ‘The man has a house’, Coptic must say 
‘There exists in the hand of the man (a) house’ (oun-te.p.rwme hi+). It is to be noted that the object stands 
directly after the subject without any introductory particle; e.g. oun-te.p.4hre n-.p.rwme ecousia ‘The Son 
of Man has authority’ (Mt 9:6). When, however, the subject is a pronoun, the relation of the object possessed 
to the possessor depends on the form of the verb used:
§235. With oun-te= and mn-te=, the object stands directly after the pronoun; e.g. oun-5 5ou gar n-.son ‘For 
I have five brothers’ (Lk 16:28), 6en.esoou e.mn-t.ou.4we 6i`w.ou ‘Sheep which have no shepherd over 
them’ (Mk 6:34). Note: The adverb m-mau ‘T
  here’
 
  (Crum 196b) frequently follows the object, but is often left 
untranslated; e.g. oun-.t.ou mwushs m-mau mn- ne.profhths ‘They have Moses and the prophets’ (Lk 16:29), 
m-.mn-.5 6ai m-.mau ‘I have no husband’ (Jn 4:17).
§236. (b) With oun-ta= and mn-ta= the object, if nominal, must always be introduced by the particle n-. It 
may be noted that the adverb m-mau (§235n), when used after oun-ta=, usually stands directly after the 
subject; e.g. ounta.s m-mau n-.ou.kolasis ‘She has punishment’ (I-Jn 4:18), ne.un-ta.3 (for ne.oun-ta.3) m-
mau n-.6a6 n-.n-.ka ‘He had many possessions’ (Mt 19:22). But when the object is pronominal, the rule is that it 
is added directly to the verbal form— thus presenting the curious form of two suffixes added directly to the 
verb; e.g. oun-ta.i+.3 ‘I have him’, oun-ta.3.s- ‘He has it’ (§232), ou gar pet.e.oun-ta.i+.3- 6n-.t.pe ‘For who 
is it whom I have in heaven?’ (Ps 72:25). Note 1: Sometimes a euphonic s is introduced between the two 
suffixes; e.g. kata pete oun-ta.3.s.3- ‘According to him who has it’, kata pete mn-ta.3.s.3-  ‘According to 
him who has it not’ (II-Cor 8:12). Note 2: With the preposition e-, ero=, an idiomatic use of oun-te-, oun-
ta= has the meaning ‘T
  o be in debt’
 
 ; e.g. oun-te.pa.`oeis ouhr ero.k ‘How much dost thou owe my lord?’ 
38

--- Page 39 ---
(lit. My lord has how much against thee?) (Lk 16.5), pai+ e.ne.un-ta.3 ero.3 n-.4e n-.satreere ‘This one who owed 
him a hundred staters’ (lit. This one who, he had against him a hundred staters) (Mt 18:28).
§237. 6aps ‘I  t is necessary’
 
  is an impersonal verb and is usually followed by the Causative Infinitive (§256); 
e.g. 6aps e.tre.u.`pe.thutn- n-.ke.sop ‘It is necessary for you to be born again’ (lit. ... that they beget you 
again, §259; Jn 3:7), mh n-.6aps an etre.pe.x\s\ 4ep.nai+ ‘Is it not necessary for Christ to receive these 
(things)?’ (Lk 24:26). Sometimes the Existential Particle pe appears after the verb; e.g. 6aps gar pe etre.3 
r-.r-ro ‘It is necessary for him to reign’ (I-Cor 15:25), 6aps on pe e.tre.u.pwwne 4wpe m-.p.ke.nomos ‘It is 
necessary again for a change to happen in the law also’ (Heb 7:12).
§237a. 6w ‘T
  o suffice, become enough’
 
  is generally used impersonally, and is followed by the preposition 
e-; e.g. ma.tsbo.n e.pek.eiwt auw 6w ero.n ‘Show us thy Father, and it is sufficient for us (Jn 14:8), 6w 
e.pe.sboui ‘It is sufficient for the disciple’ (Mt 10:25).
§238. The Imperative. As a rule the Imperative is expressed by means of the Infinitive, the same 
form being used for both singular and plural, and no distinction in gender is made; swtm- ‘Hear!’, me6 
n-.6udria ‘Fill the water pots!’, moute e.n-.ergaths ‘Call the laborers!’, `it.3- ‘Take him!’
§239. A few verbs have preserved old Imperative forms, mostly showing initial a- which originated from 
the old Imperative prefix ’i. These Imperatives are:
a.nau
‘See!’
a.`w (with direct object a.`i-, a.`i= )
‘Say!’
a.`w6m-
‘Become unclean!’
a.uwn (for a.ouwn, §16)
‘Open!’
Note: a.lo.k, a.lw.tn- (require object suffix)
‘Cease thou/you!’
§240. A few verbs show quite irregular forms:
Verb
Meaning
Imperative
ei
‘To come’
amou (masc), amh (fem), amh(e)i.tn- (plural)
eine
‘To bring’
an(e)ine, ani-, ani=
eire
‘To do’
arire, ari-, ari=, 3 pl ari.sou (§44)
5 ‘To give’ occasionally uses the Infinitive to express the Imperative; e.g. 5.6th.tn- ‘Give heed!’ (Mt 7:15). 
But far more common is the form ma (Absolute and Construct forms are identical); e.g. ma na.n ‘Give to us!’ (Mk 
10:37). ma is also frequently used in forming the Imperatives of the Causative verbs with t- prefix; e.g. 
ma.t.b-bo (for ma.t.ouop) ‘Be cleansed/purified!’, ma.tamio ‘Make!’ However, the Infinitive of these 
causatives can also be used to express the Imperative; e.g. t.b-bo ‘Become clean!’, tamio ‘Make!’ Note: 
au-, auei= ‘Give away!’ and mo- ‘Take!’, which shows a plural m-mhei.tn-.
§241. When more than one Imperative appears in a sentence, the second Imperative and any further 
Imperative is replaced by the Conjunctive (§226a); e.g. amou n.g-.nau ‘Come (and) see!’
§242. Negation of the Imperative. Negation is effected by means of the verbal prefix m-p.r-- ‘Do not do’, 
placed before the infinitive; e.g. m-p.r-.swtm- ‘Do not hear’, m-p.r-.r.6ote ‘Do not fear’. For use of m-p.r-- with 
the Causative Infinitive to form the negation of the Optative, §221.
§243. Uses of the Infinitive. Three forms of the Infinitive exist in Coptic:
(1) The Simple Infinitive; e.g. swtm- ‘To hear’, kmom ‘To become black’.
(2) The Potential Infinitive, a compound form; e.g. 4-.4a`e ‘To be able to speak’.
(3) The Causative Infinitive, also a compound form, which takes an object, nominal or pronominal, after 
the prefix tre-; e.g. tre.3.swtm- ‘To cause him to hear’, tre.p.rwme.swtm- ‘To cause the man to hear’, 
tre.k.swtm- ‘To cause thee to hear’. When the object is pronominal the following Causative forms occur:

§244. Negation of the Infinitive. Negation of the three forms of the Infinitive is effected by means of the 
particle tm-- placed immediately before the infinitive; e.g. tm-.swtm- ‘Not to hear’.
§245. The Simple Infinitive. As has already been noted (§138), the Infinitive is a masculine noun and 
as such it can be defined by the Definite Article, the Possessive Adjective or the Demonstrative Pronoun; e.g. 
p.4w3 ‘The desolation’, p.swtm- ‘The hearing’, p.4a`e ‘The saying, the Logos’, pes.kwte ‘Its surrounding’, 
petn-.rw4e ‘Your sufficiency’, peu.6ise ‘Their toil’, pei+.4a`e ‘This saying/Logos’. Note: When followed by 
a genitive, the Infinitive is linked to its possessor by means of the particle n-; e.g. p.swnt m-.p.noute ‘The 
creation of God’. Often the Infinitive retains its verbal force and takes an object; e.g. p.mere.nen.erhu ‘The 
love of our fellows’, p.koos.t ‘My burial’ (lit. The burying me).
§246. The Infinitive with the Indefinite Article is used mainly with the preposition 6n-- ‘In’, to form adverbial 
phrases; e.g. 6n-.ou.wr` ‘Securely’ (lit. In a becoming secure), 6n-.ou.rw4e ‘Moderately’ (lit. In a becoming 
sufficient), 6n-.ou.ouwn6 ebol ‘Openly’ (lit. In a showing forth). The Infinitive with the Indefinite Article is less 
frequently used independently; e.g. 5.swtm- `e oun- 6en.pwr` n-.6ht.thutn-  ‘I hear that there are divisions 
among you’ (I-Cor 11:18).
§247. The Infinitive preceded by the preposition 6n-- and the Indefinite Article is sometimes used to 
strengthen the verbal action (cf the Hebrew Infinitive Absolute in similar use; van der Merwe, Naudé & Kroeze, A 
Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar, 20.2). As a rule the Infinitive stands before the verb which it intensifies; 
e.g. auw 6n-.ou.fwte 3.na.fwte ebol m-.pe.xananios ‘And he will utterly destroy the Canaanite(s)’ (lit. In 
a destroying he will destroy, Josh 3:10).
§248. The Infinitive is used without the Article: (1) As the Subject of a Non-Verbal Sentence; e.g. 
ou.at.2om pe ou.`ai xwris pe.qbbio n-.6ht ‘Salvation without humbleness of heart is not possible’ (lit. An 
impossibility it is, salvation without the humbleness of heart) (Z 301.b.2), m-pw.tn- an pe soun-.ne.uoi+4 
mn-.ne.xronos ‘Knowledge of the times and the seasons is not yours’ (lit. Not yours it is, knowing the times and 
seasons, Acts 1:7).
§249. (2) As a genitive after 4ou- ‘W
  orthy of’
 
  (§60f). This rule also holds good in the case of many 
compound nouns and in Adjective equivalents (§60, 63, 88, 90, 101).
§250. (3) As the direct object in Compound Verbs (§177); e.g. 5.wp ‘To give account’, 5.2wnt ‘To provoke’.
§251. (4) After prepositions: (a) e- ‘I  n order to’
 
  (i) Expressing aim or purpose; e.g. a.3.`oou n-.ne3.6m-6al 
4a.n-.oueeih e.`i.n-.ne3.karpos ‘He sent his servants to the husbandmen to take his fruits’ (Mt 21:34). It 
frequently follows the Greek 6wste (ωστε ‘So as to’); e.g. m-p.r-.6w6 6wste e.r.ponhros ‘Do not be angry so 
as to commit wickedness’ (Ps 37:8). (ii) After verbs of wishing, allowing, ordering, promising, swearing, 
intending, being able; and after the impersonal verbs to be possible, to be befitting, and their negatives; 
e.g. nte.tn-.tm-.meeue e.`oo.s ‘And do not think to say’ (Mt 3:9), n-.na.kaa.k e.eia.rat ene6 ‘I shall never 
allow thee to wash my foot’ (Jn 13:8), oun-.2om m-mw.tn- esw ‘Is it possible for you to drink?’ (Mt 20:22), 4-4e 
de ero.n e.ra4e ‘It is befitting for us to rejoice’ (Lk 15:32), 6n-.ou.ana4 a.n.wrk- n-.nen.erhu 
e.tm-.tep.laau 4an.tn- 6wtb- m-.paulos ‘By an oath we have sworn among our fellows not to taste 
anything until we have killed Paul’ (Acts 23:14).
§252. (b) n-- with object verb of willing, desiring, beginning, anticipating, understanding, loving, fearing, 
and after m-p4a ‘To be worthy’; e.g. a.i.epiqumei n-.ouwm ‘I have desired to eat’ (Lk 22:15), se.me 
n-.a6.erat.ou 6n- n-.sunagwgh ‘They love to stand in the synagogues’ (Mt 6:5), n-.5.m-p.4a n-.3i 6a pe3.tooue 
‘I am not worthy to bear his shoe’ (Mt 3:11).
§252a. (c) n-sa- ‘Subsequently, consequently’; e.g. a.3.4ine n-sa.swtm- e.p.4a`e ‘He sought to hear the 
Logos’ (Acts 13:7).
§253. The Potential Infinitive. The Construct form e4- or 4-- ‘T
  o be able’
 
  can stand before another 
Infinitive to express potentiality; e.g. 6ws de n-.se.4-.ouw6 6a.tes.6aibes ‘So as they are able to dwell 
under its shadow’ (Mk 4:32). Often it is used with reference to Future time; e.g. te3.genea nim 
pet.na.e4.tauos ‘As for his generation, who will be able to show it?’ (Acts 8:33). It is very common before 
the compound verb 2m-.2om ‘T
  o be powerful’
 
 ; e.g. m-pe.laau e.4.2m-.2om e.ouo4be.3 n-.ou.4a`e ‘No one 
was able to answer him a word’ (Mt 22:46), m-p.ou.e4.2m-.2om e.pisteue ‘They were not able to believe’ (Jn 
12:39). In the form 4-.2om it is used as an undefined Substantive after the Impersonal verbs oun- and (m-)mn-- 
(§233); e.g. oun-.4-.2om mmo.i+ ebwl ebol m-.pe.rpe m-.p.noute ‘It is possible for me to overthrow the 
temple of God’ (Mt 26:61), m-mn-.4.2om etre.3.4wpe na.i+ m-.maqhths ‘It is not possible to cause him to 
become a disciple to me’ (Lk 14:27).
§254. The Causative Infinitive. Like the Simple Infinitive, the Causative Infinitive can be used as a 
40

--- Page 41 ---
substantive; e.g. eis pei.tre.tn-.lupi gar kata p.noute a.3.r-.6wb nhtn- e.u.no2 n-.spoudh ‘For lo, this 
causing you to grieve in respect of God has produced for you a great earnestness’ (II-Cor 7:11).
§255. It can be preceded by one of the auxiliaries; e.g. a.3.tra.ouw6 6n-.ou.ma n-.ouotouot ‘He 
caused me to dwell in a green place’ (Ps 23:2), k.na.tra.swtm- e.u.telhl mn- ou.ouno3 ‘Thou wilt cause me 
to hear joy and gladness’ (Ps 50:8).
§256. Preceded by a Preposition: (a) e- precedes the Causative Infinitive, especially when the main verb 
is one of expressing a wish, a command, a decision, a prohibition, a petition or the like; e.g. n-.tn-.oue4 pai 
an e.tre.3.r-.r-ro e`w.n ‘We do not wish that this man should reign over us’ (lit. We do not wish this [one] to 
cause him to reign over us, Lk 19:14), a.3.oue6 sa6ne de na.u e.tre.u.no`.ou thr.ou ‘He commanded them 
that they should all recline’ (Mk 6:39), a.u.arxei de n-.se.pswp.3- etre.3 p.wwne ebol 6n-.neu.to4 ‘They 
began to beseech him to cause him to remove out of their boundaries’ (Mk 5:17). Thus preceded by e-, the 
Causative Infinite is very common following an Impersonal Verb; e.g. 6aps- etre.6hlias ei ‘It is necessary 
for Elijah to come’  (Mt 17:10), a.s.4wpe e.tre.3.lo 6m-.p.4wne ‘It happened for him to recover from the 
sickness’ (Z 288.a.12), m-mn-.4-.2om gar `in tenou e.tre.koikonomei ‘For it is not possible from now on for 
thee to be steward’ (Lk 16:2).
§257. (b) mn-n-sa precedes the Causative Infinitive to form the Temporal clause meaning ‘A
  fter’
 
 ; e.g. mn-n-
sa.tre.3.mou n-2i mwushs ‘After the death of Moses’ (lit. After he died, namely Moses, Josh 1:1), mn-n-
sa.tre.3.4a`e nm-ma.u ‘After he spoke with them’ (Mk 16:19); see §389.
§258. (c) 6n- precedes the Causative Infinitive, which takes the Definite Article p-, to form Temporal Clauses 
with the meaning ‘W
  hen, while, as’
 
  (always contemporaneous time). It should be noted that the Article shows 
the form p-, and not pe- as would normally be expected before the double consonants tre-; e.g. a.s.4wpe 
de 6m-.p.tre.3.bwk e.6oun e.p.hi+ ‘It happened when he was going into the house’ (Lk 14:1), 
6m-.p.tre.p.rwme na`.3- mauaa.3 n-.na6.rm-.p.noute ‘When the man casts himself before God’ (Z 332.d.1); cf 
§392.
§259. The Passive. A separate formation for the Passive does not exist in Coptic. As has been noted 
(§139), the Infinitives of many verbs may express either an Active or a Passive sense. In order to express 
the Passive, Coptic has to resort to circumlocution by employing the 3rd pers plural suffix with the active 
tense. Thus to express ‘He was killed’, Coptic has to say ‘They killed him’; e.g. i\s\ de nte.r.ou `po.3 6rai+ 
6n-.bhqleem ‘When Jesus had been born in Bethlehem’ (lit. Jesus, when they had brought him forth in Bethlehem) 
(Mt 2:1), a.u.`oo.s ‘It was said’ (lit. They said it). The agent is introduced by the preposition: 6itn--, 
6itoot= (or ebol 6itn--, ebol 6itoot=); e.g. ou.rwme e.a.u.tn-noou.3- ebol 6itm-.p.noute ‘A man who 
had been sent by God’ (Jn 1:6), a.u.swbe m-mo.3 ebol 6itn-.m-.magos ‘He was mocked by the Magi’ (Mt 2:16). 
Note: Compound verbs which are formed by means of `i- ‘Receive’ and a following infinitive or noun (§177) 
are passive; e.g. 6m-.p.tre.p.laos thr.3- `i baptisma ‘When all the people were being baptized’ (Lk 3:21), 
se.na.`i.smou n-2i m-.patria thr.ou m-.p.ka6 ‘They will be blessed, namely all the families of the earth’ 
(Acts 3:25).
Chapter XII. Particles.
§260. Prepositions. Prepositions are simple or compound (e.g. e- ‘To’, e.`n-- ‘Upon’). They can be 
prefixed to nouns or pronouns. When used before a noun, the preposition shows the Construct form (e.g. 
e.p.rwme ‘To the man’); but if used before a pronoun, then the Pronominal form is employed (e.g. ero.3 
‘To him’). The pronoun is represented by the suffix form (§35). The pronominal forms are etymologically 
interesting in that they preserve weak consonants which have been lost in the Construct forms.
Simple Prepositions:
§261. e-, ero= (2 plural erw.tn-) [old r] is used for many purposes. The fundamental meanings are ‘T
  o, for,
 
  
from, than’.
(1) Dative: ‘T
  o, for, according to, as regards’
 
 ; e.g. bwk ng-.touo.k e.p.ouhhb ‘Go, show thyself to the 
priest’, a.3.r-.ou.no2 n-.4ops ero.3 ‘He made a great feast for him’, pet m-mau na.t.sabe.thutn- e.6wb nim 
‘That one will teach you as regards everything’ (Jn 14:26).
(2) Purpose: ‘I  n order to’
 
  (§251).
(3) Direction: ‘T

 ; e.g. a.3.kot.3- e.m-.maqhths ‘He turned himself towards the disciples’, 
e.k.e.`oou.3- e.p.hi+ ‘Thou shalt send him to the house’.
(4) In a hostile sense: ‘A
  gainst’
 
 ; e.g. a6ro.ou nai+ r-.mn-tre ero.k ‘Why do these witness against thee?’. 
Especially in the sense of debt or responsibility (§236.2).
(5) ‘F
  rom’
 
 ; e.g. ma tou`o.i+ e.na.`a`e ‘(Give) to save me from my enemies!’
(6) Comparison (§114).

(5) To introduce the Object, when the Construct or Pronominal form of the verb is not used (§328); e.g. 
5.`w m-mo.s ‘I say it’, 3-.moste m-.p.ouoein ‘He hates the light’.
(6) After the verbs 4wpe ‘To become’ and o ‘To be’ (Qual of eire ‘To make, do’), to introduce the qualification 
of the subject; e.g. pai+ e.nta.3.4wpe m-.p.rodoths ‘This one who became the traitor’, 5.o n-.6m-6al na.3 ‘I 
am his servant (lit. I am made servant to him)’.
(7) With those verbs which take a Second Object, to introduce the Second Object; e.g. a.u.aa.3 n-.r-ro ‘They 
made him king’.
§262a. The Pronominal forms m-mo= are used: (a) After the particle m-min or m-mine to lend emphasis to the 
notion of possession; e.g. te3.5me m-min m-mo.3 ‘His own village’, pe3.eoou mmine m-mo.3 ‘His own glory’;

§272. Compound Prepositions. By means of the Simple Prepositions prefixed to the nouns describing 
parts of the body which could take the possessive suffix (§38), Coptic was able to form a wide range of 
Compound Prepositions. The most important of these are:
§273. Compounds with e-.
(1) ern-- (eron--), erw= (lit. To the mouth of) ‘  T  o, upon’
 
 , mostly with verbs of motion; e.g. a.3.6wn e6oun

‘Thy neighbor’.
(5) 6i6ra= ‘O
  n the face of’
 
 ; e.g. 6i6ra.u m-.p.moou ‘On the face of the water’.
(6) 6i`n-, 6i`w= (lit. On the head) ‘U
  pon, over’
 
 ; e.g. 6i`n-.ou.pinac ‘Upon a dish’, nh` 6i`n-.ou.2lo2 ‘Laying 
upon a bed’, t.mn-t.ero  m-.p.eiwt  e.s.por4  ebol  6i`m-  p.ka6  ‘The Sovereignty of the Father is spread 
upon the earth’ (Th 113). Note the Relative Substantive formed by the Compound pet.6i`n-- ‘He who is 
over, in command’; e.g. pet.6i`n-.net.w6s ‘The one in command of the reapers’.
§278. a`n-- (e`n--), a`n-t= (e`n-t=) ‘W
  ithout’
 
 ; e.g. a`n-t.3- m-pe.laau 4wpe ‘Without him did not anything 
come into being’, a`m-.parabolh m-p.3-.`e laau ‘Without parable he did not say anything’.
§279. `in- ‘F
  rom, since’
 
 ; e.g. `in.p.ma n-.6wtp- m-.p.rh ‘From the place of the setting of the sun’ (Josh 1:4), 
`in.t.eunou et.m-mau ‘From that hour’, `in.t.arxh m-.p.swnt ‘Since the beginning of creation’.
§280. Greek Prepositions used in Coptic.
The commonest of these are:
kata-, kataro=
‘According to, after’
para- (also m-.para-), pararo=
‘More than’
eimhti-
‘Except’
xwris- (the following noun is usually without the article)
 ‘Without’
6ws- (the following noun is without the article)
‘As’
Chapter XIII. The Adverb.
§281. There is no special Adverb Formation. In order to qualify the verbal action, Coptic uses a noun 
or infinitive prefaced by a preposition. A few substantives are used absolutely without a prefixed 
preposition. The most important of these are:
 arhu
 ‘Perhaps’
 bol
 ‘Outwards’
 ene6
 ‘Ever’
 na.me
 ‘Truly’
 on
 ‘Again, still’
 pa6ou
 ‘Behind’
 sop
 ‘Sometimes’
 ke.sop
 ‘Another time’
 tai+
 ‘Here’
 twn
 ‘Where’
 te.nou (for te.ounou)
 ‘At once’ 
 tnau
 ‘When’
 6oun
 ‘Within’
 6rai+
 ‘Upwards’ (old hry [h dotted])
 ‘Downwards’ (old hry)
 2eph
 ‘Quickly’
 me4ak*
 ‘Perhaps’
*Note: me4ak was originally a verb which took pronominal suffixes; e.g. me4ak n-to.3 pe pe.x\s\ ‘Perhaps 
he is the Christ’.
§282. Adverbial Phrases. Substantives with prefixed preposition used adverbially.  The substantive may or 
may not be defined.
(1) With e-.
  e.bol
 ‘Outwards’: this is the commonest of all adverb equivalents, 
and is frequently to be left untranslated.
  e.mate
 ‘Very’
  e.mau
 ‘There’

 ‘Again’ (§111n)
  n-.6ht 
 ‘In heart’, especially common after verbs expressing 
moral activity and mental perception; not necessarily 
translated.
§284. (3) With 6n-- the substantive takes the article; e.g. 6n-.t.pa4e ‘At midnight’, 6m-.poou (for 6m-.p.6oou) 
‘Today’, 6n-.ou.me ‘Truly’, 6n-.ou.4p-n-.4wp ‘Suddenly’. For adverbial phrases formed with 6n- and the 
Infinitive with the Indefinite Article, §246.

 ‘Away’
  sa.sa nim 
 ‘Everywhere’
  sa.ounam
 ‘To the right’
  sa.6bour
 ‘To the left’
  sa.6rai+
 ‘Upwards’
§286. Greek Adverbs frequently appear in Coptic texts. They usually stand absolutely, i.e. without 
introductory preposition; e.g. a.3.`e pe3.a6e ebol kakws ‘He spent his life badly’, kalws a.3.profhteue 
6arw.tn- ‘Well did he prophesy about you’. Occasionally a Greek word is introduced by 6n- followed by the 
Indefinite article, to form an Adverbial Phrase; e.g. 6n-.ou.amelia ‘Carelessly’.
§287. Conjunctions. While it is true that Coptic possesses conjunctions which have survived from the older 
stage of the language, it also uses a wide variety of Greek conjunctions, many of which became part and 
parcel of the language. A list of the principal conjunctions is given in the next section. The Coptic conjunction 
appears first and is followed by the loan conjunctions from Greek. Notes on a few of the more important 
conjunctions follow in §290-95.

§290. Notes on Conjunctions. (1) auw ‘A
  nd’
 
  (originating from a.ouw6, the Imperative of ouw6 ‘To put, set’) is 
used primarily to join together sentences.  It is less commonly used to join nouns together; for this purpose 
Coptic more correctly used the prepositions mn-- (§264.2) and 6i- (§268.5); e.g. p.rh na.r-.kake auw p.oo6 
n.3-.na.5 an m-pe.3.ouoein auw n-.siou se.na.6e ebol 6n-.t.pe auw n-.2om n-.m-.phue se.na.noein ‘The sun 
will become darkness and the moon will not give its light; and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers 
of heaven will tremble’ (Mk 13:24-25). Sometimes auw is used to join sentences when the sentences are 
already joined by use of the Conjunctive (§225); e.g. er4an ou.eiwt n-.asebhs `po n-.ou.4hre n-.aikaios 
auw pai+ n.3-.nau e-.n.nobe ere.te3.eiwt eire m-mo.ou auw n.3-.r-6ote n.3-.sa6ww.3 ebol m-mo.ou 
e.3.e.wn6 6n- te3.dikaiosunh ‘If a wicked father begets a righteous son, and this (one) sees the sins while 
his father is committing them, and he fears and removes himself from them, may he live¹ by his 
righteousness!’ (¹Future Energetic, §217; Apa Victor, Steindorff Grammar 49*, lines 1-4)
§291. (2) auw on ‘M
  oreover, furthermore’
 
 ; e.g. a.penta.k.`oo.3 4wpe auw on oun- ma ‘That which thou 
hast said¹, has happened; moreover there is room still’. (¹II Perfect, §202; Lk 14:22)
§292. (3) `n-, `en- (less correctly `in-) ‘Or’; e.g. e.k.`w na.n n-.tei.parabolh `en e.k.`w m-mo.s e.ouon 
nim ‘Art thou saying this parable to us or art thou saying it to everyone?’ (Lk 12:41), barabbas `n-  i\s\ 
‘Barabbas or Jesus’ (Mt 27:7).
§293. (4)
n-to3
‘But rather’
6ww3
‘But on the other hand’
-2e
‘Then, therefore, but’
n-tooun
‘Then’
These do not stand at the beginning of the sentence, but rather follow an introductory word: noun, verbal 
form, etc.; e.g. p.`ioua de n-to3 m-.pe.p\n\a\ n-.se.na.kaa.3 (an) ebol ‘But the blasphemy in respect of the 
Spirit will not be forgiven’ (Mt 12:31), pet.eira n-to3 n-.t.me 4a.3.ei 4a.p.ouoein ‘But he who does the 
truth is wont to come to the light’ (Jn 3:21), ne oun-.ta.i+ 6ww3 n-.ou.maau ‘I had, on the other hand, a 
mother’ (Z 327.c.11), 5.na.bwk n-tooun 4a ou.son ‘I will go then to a brother’ (Z 306.c.4), a.3.ei.2e on 
e.t.kana ‘He came therefore again to Cana’ (Jn 4:46). (5) -2e in negative statements has the meaning 
‘(  Not) again, (no) more’
 
 ; e.g. n-.5.na.moute.2e an erw.tn- `e na.6m-6al ‘I shall not again call you my 
servants’ (Jn 15:15), auw p.kosmos 2e
.
 na.nau ero.i an ‘And the world will see me no more’ (Jn 14:19).
§294. (6) `e, an unaccented particle, originating from the old rdd (lit. To say). It is used in a number of 
ways: (a) Apposition: ‘Namely, viz., i.e.’; e.g. ou.polis `e kalonia (for kolonia) ‘A city, i.e. a colony’ 
(Acts 16:12). It is used after a verb of calling or naming, to indicate the second object; e.g. etbe ou tet.n-
a.moute ero.i+ `e noemin ‘Why will you call me Naomi?’ (Ruth 1:21).
§295. (b) To introduce Direct speech; §337. (c) To introduce Indirect speech; §337. (d) To introduce 
Causal Clauses; §373. (e) To introduce Final Clauses; §369. NB: the tenses of the verbs preceding and 
following `e are independent of one another.
§296. Interjections. Coptic possesses few interjections. The following may be noted:
(1) eis ‘L
  o, behold!’
 
 : properly used before a noun; e.g. eis ou.israhliths na.me ‘Behold, an Israelite 
indeed!’ (Jn 1:47).
(2) eis.6hhte ‘L
  o, behold!’
 
 : properly used before a pronoun or verb; e.g. eis.6hte 5.na.`eu pa.aggelos 
‘Behold, I shall send my messenger!’ (Mk 1:2). Note: Occasionally 6hhte appears in the forms 6hhpe and 
6hhne. In other words, the particle is made to agree in gender and number with the subject of the sentence; 
e.g. eis.6hhne se.6n-.amn-te nm-ma.3 auw eis.6hhpe 3-.6m-.p.kake nm-na.u ‘Lo, they are in Amente¹ with 
him, and he is in the darkness with them’ (¹Crum 008b; Z 590.9).
(3) ouoi+ ‘Woe!’, followed by the dative; e.g. ouoi+ na.i+ ‘Woe to me!’
(4) 6amoi+ ‘W
  ould that, Oh that!’
 
 , followed by the prefix ene- (§380) and the Imperfect or Future Imperfect; 
e.g. 6amoi+ on ene.n.eire m-.pet.soutwn ‘Oh that we might do what is upright!’ (Ming. 322). In Biblical texts 
6amoi+ is less commonly found in Sahidic than in Bohairic (Boh form amoi). Sahidic generally substitutes for 
6amoi+ the impersonal nanou.s ‘It is good’; e.g. nanou.s ene.tet.na.anexe m-mo.i+ n-.ou.koui m-.mn-
t.aq.ht (i.e. m-.mn-t.at.6ht) ‘Would that you would bear with me in a little foolishness!’ (II-Cor 11:1).
§297. (5) 6a(e)io is the interjection of entreaty, ‘Y
  ea, verily!’
 
 ; e.g. 6a(e)io 5.`w m-mo.s nh.tn- `e 
a.ri.6ote 6ht.3- m-.pai+ ‘Yea; I say to you, Fear this one!’ (Lk 12:5).
(6) m-pwr is the interjection of deprecation, ‘D
  o not!, By no means!, No!’
 
 ; e.g. m-pwr na.4eere m-p.r2w 
47

--- Page 48 ---
6i.nai+ ‘No, my daughters, do not remain thus!’ (Ruth 1:13). It is frequently found preceding the Negation of 
the Imperative.
Chapter XIV. Syntax.
§298. The Sentence. Two types of sentence occur in Coptic: the Non-Verbal and the Verbal Sentence. 
The Verbal Sentence can be further subdivided into Durative Verbal and Limitative Verbal Sentences. 
The Durative Verbal Sentence may be said to form a kind of bridge between the Non-Verbal and the 
Limitative Verbal Sentence, for it shows features of both types of sentence. For example, the Imperfect 
tense often shows the Existential Particle pe after the Verbal Form, which in the Non-Verbal Sentence stands 
for the logical subject. A satisfactory theory of the Sentence in Coptic remains to be worked out. In the 
following pages no attempt is made to present any new explanation. Notes with the introductory 
‘Observation’ must be regarded as suggestions on my part; cf for example the observations below (§329.Obs) 
on the Direct and Oblique Object.
§299. The Non-Verbal Sentence. The Non-Verbal Sentence is a sentence which has no proper verb in the 
predicate, the Copula (‘Am, is, are, was, etc.’) being understood. It consists of two parts: (1) The Subject, 
noun or pronoun. (2) The Predicate: noun, pronoun, adverb (or adverbial phrase). The predicate can be 
either Nominal or Adverbial. The Adjectival Predicate had ceased to exist; such adjectives as did survive 
from the older stage of the language were treated as substantives (§104) and therefore appear as Nominal 
Predicates.
§300. The Non-Verbal Sentence can be divided into two groups: (1) The Subject stands first; (2) The 
Predicate stands first.
§301. Group I: The Subject Stands First: (1) When the Subject is the 1st or 2nd Person. To express the 
Subject, use is made of the Independent Pronouns (§45). The Predicate Noun must be defined by the Article 
or Possessive Adjective; e.g. anok ou.rwme n-.re3.r-.nobe ‘I (am) a sinful man’ (Z 321.26). The Construct 
Form of the Independent Pronoun is more usual than the Absolute Form—compare the foregoing example 
with the form giving the same meaning in Lk 5:8: ang-.ou.rwme n-.re3.r-.nobe; further examples which 
might be quoted are: n-te.ou.s6ime ‘Thou (art) a woman’ (Ruth 3:11), n-te tn
.
- 6en.makarios para n-.rwme 
thr.ou ‘You (are) more blessed than all men’ (Pistis Sophia 15).
§302. The Subject is often strengthened by using the Absolute Form and following it with the Construct 
Form; e.g. n-tw.tn-  n-te.tn-.na.4beer ‘You (are) my friends’ (Jn 15:14), anok de ang-.ou.3n-t ang-.ou.rwme 
an ‘I (am) a worm; I (am) not a man’ (Ps 21:6).
§303. The equivalent of an Adjectival Predicate is effected by means of the Compound Preposition 
ebol.6n-- ‘Out of’ placed before a defined Substantive, the whole phrase being prefaced by the Indefinite 
Article; e.g. n-te.tn- 6en ebol.6m-.pei.kosmos ‘You (are) worldly’ (lit. You [are] some out of this world) (Jn 
8:23).
§304. The Subject stands first: (2) When the Predicate is an adverb or its equivalent: (a) With Nominal 
Subject; e.g. pa.eiwt n-.6ht ‘My Father (is) in me’ (Jn 14:11), pe.p\n\a\ m-.p.`oeis e.6rai+ e`w.i+ ‘The Spirit of 
the Lord (is) upon me’ (Lk 4:18).
§305. (b) When the Subject is pronominal, 1st, 2nd or 3rd person, the Pronominal forms of I Present (§188) 
are used; e.g. 5.6m-.pa.eiwt ‘I (am) in my Father’ (Jn 14:10), nai+ se.6m-.p.kosmos ‘These, they (are) in the 
world’ (Jn 17:10). Observation: The Independent Pronouns can be used before an Adverbial Predicate, 
especially when the Pronominal form of I Present has been used at the beginning of the sentence. The 
subsequent Pronouns show Absolute forms; e.g. anok 5.6m-.pa.eiwt auw n-tw.tn- n-.6ht auw anok 
n-.6ht.thutn-  ‘I (am) in my Father, and you (are) in me, and I (am) in you’ (Jn 14:20).
§306. Group II: The Predicate Stands First. When the Subject is the Third Person, and the Predicate 
contains a defined noun or Independent Pronoun but not an adverb or its equivalent, the Subject is 
represented by the Existential Particles pe, te, ne, which agree in number and gender with the 
Predicate. These Particles, representing the Logical Subject, can be compared with the English ‘It is’ and 
French ‘C'est’; e.g. pai+ pe ‘It is this’ (lit. This, it is), ou.no2 pe ‘He is great’ (lit. A great one, he is; Z 313.b.6), 
ten.sarc te ‘He is our flesh’ (Gen 37:27), ne3.eiote ne ‘They are his parents’ (Jn 9:2).
§307. When the Subject is expressed by a noun, it stands in apposition after the Existential Particle 
representing the Logical Subject; e.g. pe.2ro2 pe p.4a`e m-.p.noute ‘The Logos of God is the seed’ (lit. The 
seed, the Logos of God it is; Lk 8:11). This construction Predicate-Particle-Subject is also used when the 
Predicate is a Pronoun, whether Independent, Possessive, Demonstrative or Interrogative; e.g. anok pe p.ro 
‘I Am the door’ (Jn 10:9), nai+ de ne penta.u.6e 6atn- te.6ih ‘These are the ones which fell by the way’ (Mk 
4:15), ou pe pei+.6wb ‘What is this work?’ (Z 323.a.1). For Possessive Pronoun, cf §248, 2nd example. Note: 
Coptic expresses the conjunction ‘S
  o, thus’
 
  by the Non-Verbal Sentence: tai+ te q.e (for t.6e) ‘This is the 
way (or manner)’; e.g. tai+ te q.e 4hn nim et.nanou.3 4a.3.taue karpos ebol e.nanou.3 ‘So every 
48

--- Page 49 ---
good tree is wont to produce good fruit’ (Mt 7:17).
§308. Concord. When the Predicate is an Independent Pronoun, 1st or 2nd Person, singular or plural, the 
Existential Particle representing the Logical Subject generally appears as pe; e.g. anok pe p.4ws 
et.nanou.3 ‘I Am the good shepherd’ (Jn 10:11), n-tw.tn- pe p.ouein m-.p.kosmos ‘You are the light of the 
world’ (Mt 5:14). However, when the Subject and Predicate are nouns of the same number and gender, the 
Existential Particle is in accord; e.g. ta.nai+ gar n-.tei+.mine te t.mn-t.ero n-.m-.phue ‘For of such a kind is 
the kingdom of the heavens’ (Mt 19:14), neu.tafos ne neu.hi+ 4a.ene6 ‘Their graves are their houses 
forever’ (Ps 48:11). But when the Predicate and the Subject differ in number and gender, the Existential 
Particle is generally pe, no attempt at concord being made; e.g. pek.4a`e pe t.me ‘Thy word is the truth’ 
(Jn 17:7), t.pe pe pa.qronos ‘Heaven is my throne’ (Acts 7:49), ou.swma n-.ouwt pe anon thr.n- ‘One body 
are we all’ (I-Cor 10:17).
§309. Emphasis. When special emphasis is laid on the Subject of Non-Verbal Sentences containing the 
Existential Particle representing the Logical Subject, the order of the sentence undergoes a change: the 
Subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence, with the Predicate and Existential Particle following; e.g. 
t.s6ime de pe.oou m-.pes.6ai te ‘The woman is the glory of her husband’ (I-Cor 11:7), n-to.ou thr.ou 
6en.agrios ne ‘They all are wild beasts’ (Z 318.a.5). As a rule in this construction, the Existential Particle is 
in accord with the subject in both number and gender. Exceptions are found; e.g. peu.las ou.sh3e te 
e.sthm ‘Their tongue is a sharp sword’ (Ps 56:5). Note: The preceding example shows a tendency which is 
fairly common in Coptic: the desire to keep the Existential Particle representing the Logical Subject as near 
as possible to the Predicate Substantive; and, when this substantive is enlarged by a genitive or relative 
clause, to place the enlargement after the Existential Particle; e.g. ou.rwme pe n-te.p.noute ‘He is a man of 
God’ (Z 348.b.16).
§310. The Past Tense of the Non-Verbal Sentence is formed by prefixing the Existential Particle ne- 
immediately before the Predicate or before the Subject, when the sentence is of the type under Group I; e.g. 
ne ou
.
.grafeus pe ‘He was a scribe’ (Z 351.12), barabbas de ne ou.soone pe ‘But Barabbas, he was a 
robber’ (Jn 18:40), ne.ang-.ou.koui ‘I was a little one’ (Ps 151:1 LXX).
§311. For the Circumstantial use of the Non-Verbal Sentence, cf §197a.n.
§312. Negation of the Non-Verbal Sentence is effected by means of the particles n- ... an; e.g. 
n-.ou.re3.`i6o an pe p.noute ‘God is not a trifler’ (Acts 10:34), p.4a`e ete.tn-.swtm- ero.3 m-.pwi an pe 
‘The Logos which you hear is not mine’ (Jn 14:24), pei.rwme n-.ou.ebol 6m- p.noute an pe ‘This man is not 
from God’ (Jn 9:16), n-.anok m-.mate an pe ‘It is not I only’ (Jn 8:16). Frequently the particle n- is omitted; e.g. 
ang.ou.rwme an ‘I (am) not a man’ (Ps 21:7).
§313. Note that it is only the Predicate which is negated, and for this reason the particle n- is usually omitted 
before the subject of Non-Verbal Sentences of the type Group I; see §301.
§314. Remarks on the Subject of Non-Verbal Sentences. As a general rule the Subject, if it is a noun, 
must be defined with the Definite Article or Possessive Adjective. There are exceptions to this rule; cf the 
examples quoted in §248. When the subject has the Indefinite Article, or no Article, the Impersonal 
Existential Verbs oun-- and (m-)mn-- (§233) are used. Strictly speaking, when these verbs are used, the 
sentence is not in fact Non-Verbal, as it contains a verb of the Old Conjugation type.
§315. The Verbal Sentence. In contrast to the Non-Verbal Sentence, the Verbal Sentence contains a finite 
verb— which may be either transitive or intransitive, as well as either Infinitive (expressing action) or 
Qualitative (expressing state). As has already been noted, the Verbal Sentence should itself be divided into 
Sentences containing Durative Tenses (§188-98) and Sentence containing Limitative Tenses (§199ff).
§316. The Durative Verbal Sentence. Sentences containing the Present, Imperfect, and Circumstantial 
Tenses, are called Durative. They are distinguished from all other Verbal Sentences in two ways: they alone 
can take the Qualitative form of the verb, and they cannot take a direct object; i.e. they must use 
the Absolute form of the verb, and cannot use the Construct or Pronominal forms (§328; exception in §329n); 
e.g. (a) Present: pei.laos t maeio
.
 m-mo.i 6n-.ne3.spotou ‘This people praise me with their lips’ (Mk 7:6), 
5.`w m-mo.s nh.tn- ‘I say it to you’; (b) Imperfect: nere.i\s\ de me m-.marqa ‘Jesus was loving Martha’ (Jn 
11:5), ne.u.4oop gar 6n-.ou.mn-t.`a`e mn-.neu.erhu ‘For they were being in enmity with one another’ (Lk 
23:12); (c) Circumstantial: ere.n-.ro 4otm ‘The doors being shut’ (Jn 20:19), n-.4hre 4hm e.u.`i4kak ebol 
6m-.pe.rpe e.u.`w m-mo.s `e wsanna p.4hre n-.daueid ‘The children crying out in the temple saying, 
Hosanna, O Son of David!’ (Mt 21:15).
§317. The Limitative Verbal Sentence. In contrast to the Durative Verbal Sentence, the Limitative 
Tenses employed in a sentence cannot take the Qualitative Form; but can take a direct object, i.e. 
they can use the Construct and Pronominal Forms of the Infinitive (see further §327-29 for qualifications of this 
general rule); e.g. a.3.`e.nai+ ‘He said these (things)’ (Lk 18:11), eis.6hhte 5.na.`eu pa.aggelos ‘Lo, I 
shall send my messenger’ (Mk 1:2), a.p.koui n-.4hre seu6-.n-.ka nim et.n-ta.3 ‘The younger son gathered 
49

--- Page 50 ---
everything which he had’ (Lk 15:13).
§318. The normal word order in the Verbal Sentence is:
(1) The Auxiliary with Subject (Noun or Pronoun)
(2) The Verbal Form
(3) The Object (Noun or Pronoun)
(4) The Dative (Noun)
(5) The Adverb
E.g. a.p.`oeis tamio n-.6en.4thn n-.4aar n-.adam ‘The Lord prepared coats of skin for Adam’ (Gen 3:21), 
a.u.n-t.3- 4a.annas n-.4orp ‘They brought him to Annas at first’ (Jn 18:13).
§319. When the Dative is Pronominal, it takes precedence over the Object of the verb. The Object 
then follows the Dative and is introduced by the particle n--; e.g. 5.na.`oou na.u n-.6en.profhths mn- 
6en.apostolos ‘I shall send to them prophets and apostles’ (Lk 11:49), 3.na.eire na.k n-.ouna ‘He will 
show to thee mercy’ (Z 309.a.6). Note: The pronoun may not precede the noun to which it refers; e.g. a.3.5 
n-.ne.skeuh n-.n-.rwme na.u ‘He gave the implements of the men to them’ (Acts Andreas and Paulus, Steindorff, 
Grammar, *35.l.18).
§320. When however the Object is Pronominal, it retains its normal position after the verb; e.g. 
(a) Durative: 5.`w m-mo.s nh.tn- ‘I say it to you’; (b) Limitative: 3.na.taa.3 nh.tn- 6m-.pa.ran ‘He will give it 
to you in my name’ (Jn 16:23).
§321. The Subject. The normal position of the Subject is at the beginning of the Sentence; e.g. 
p.rwme swtm- e.p.4a`e ‘The man hears the Logos’, 3.swtm- e.p.4a`e ‘He hears the Logos’. Strictly 
speaking, with the exception of the I Present Durative and I Future Limitative, the auxiliary verb 
precedes the subject; e.g. a.p.rwme swtm- e.p.4a`e ‘The man heard the Logos’, a.3.swtm e.p.4a`e 
‘He heard the Logos’, etc.
§322. However, it should be noted that Coptic shows a preference for the use of the Pronominal Forms of 
the auxiliaries, even when the Subject is Nominal; e.g. mwu+shs pa.6m-6al a.3.mou ‘Moses my servant is 
dead’ (lit. Moses my servant did he die; Josh 1:2), auw noemin pe`a.s n-.6rouq ‘And Naomi, she says to 
Ruth’ (Ruth 1:15). This construction is particularly common when the Sentence is connected to a preceding 
sentence by one of the Conjunctions (§287), which must stand second in word order: 2e, de, gar, etc.; e.g. 
i\s\ de pe`a.3 n-.ne3.maqhths ‘But Jesus, he says to his disciples’. Similarly, when the subject is Pronominal, 
the Independent Pronoun is used and followed by the Conjunction; e.g. n-to3 de pe`a.3 na.3 ‘But he says to 
him’ (Mt 19:17). Note: Sometimes when emphasis is laid on the Pronoun, the Independent form is used 
directly before the Pronominal forms of the Auxiliary; e.g. anok a.i.bwk eime6 p.`oeis de a.3.kto.i+ 
e.i.4oueit ‘I, I went away full; but the Lord, he has made me return empty’ (Ruth 1:21).
§323. Generally speaking, emphasis on the Subject is effected by means of the Interjections eis and 
eis.6hhte (§296); e.g. eis p.aggelos m-.p.`oeis a.3.ouwn6 na.3 ebol 6n-.ou.rasou ‘Lo, the angel of the 
Lord, he appeared to him in a dream’ (Mt 1:20).
§324. Frequently, especially in Coptic translations of Greek works, the Nominal Subject is represented by 
the Pronominal Form of the Auxiliary, and is restated more precisely at the end of the sentence. In such 
cases the Subject is indicated by the prefix n-2i-, ‘I  .e., that is’
 
 ; e.g. pe`a.u 2e na.3 n-2i.m-.maqhths 
‘Therefore they say to him, i.e. the disciples’ (Jn 11:12), a.3.bwk n-.ouei4 n-2i.pe.presbuteros n-.4iht 
4a.p.arxh.episkopos n-.rakote ‘He went once, i.e. the priest of Shiêt, to the Archbishop of Alexandria’ (Z 
292.c.1).
§325. n-2i- is also found after the Causative Infinitive to define more exactly the Pronominal form; e.g. 
6m-.p.tre.3 `wk de ebol n-2i.pe.6oou n-.t.penthkosth ‘When the Day of Pentecost was being fulfilled’ (lit. 
When it was being fulfilled, i.e. the Day of Pentecost; Acts 2:1).
§326. The Object. The Object normally follows the verbal form, except when the Dative is Pronominal 
and thus takes precedence (§319). In the case of Limitative Tenses, the Object may be added directly to the 
verbal stem. Thus with a Nominal Object, the Construct form is used; e.g. a.3.6etb- p.rwme ‘He killed the 
man’. When the Object is a Pronoun, the Pronominal form is used; e.g. a.3.6otb.3- ‘He killed him’. (1) In the 
case of a Nominal Object, the addition of the Object directly to the Verb causes the Tone to pass from the 
Verb to the Object; e.g. a.3.6etb.p.rwme (§20, 21). We might call this Object the ‘Tonal Object’. (2) 
However, when the Object is a Pronoun, it does not itself receive the Tone, but rather follows the stressed 
syllable in the Pronominal form of the Verb; e.g. a.3.kotb.3-. It might be described as the ‘Post-Tonal 
Object’, but in view of the fact that some verbs, owing to the loss of original consonants, do show a Tonal 
stress on some suffix endings (e.g. mestw.k ‘To hate thee’, sa6w.3 ‘To set him up’, etc.), a better name 
would be ‘Direct Suffix Object’. E.g. (a) Perfect: a.n-.rwme mere.p.kake n-.6ouo e.p.ouoein ‘Men loved 
darkness more than light’ (Jn 3:19), a.3.no`.3- e.pe.4teko ‘He cast him into prison’ (Mt 18:30); (b) Future: 
50

--- Page 51 ---
3.na.`ek.6wb nim ebol ‘He will fulfill everything’ (Mk 9:12), 5.na.tn-nou.3 4arw.tn-  ‘I shall send him to 
you’ (Jn 16:7); (c) Habitude: me.u.`ere ou.6hbs ‘They are not wont to light a lamp’ (Mt 5:15), 4a.u.kaa.3 
6i`n- t.luxnia ‘They are wont to put it on the lamp stand’ (ibid.).
§327. It must be noted here that with some verbs (§331-2), even if one of the Limitative Tenses is used, the 
Object cannot be the Tonal or Direct Suffix Object, but rather must be prefaced by the preposition e-, ero=, 
the verbal form of course being the Absolute Form.
§328. The older forms of the language show that, apart from some verbs mentioned above, originally the 
Direct Object— either Tonal Object or Direct Suffix Object— was the normal usage with all tenses. However, 
during the Persian Period a new usage appears in Demotic. With certain tenses, represented in Coptic by the 
Durative Tenses and including the Relative Present (§358), the Object— whether it be Nominal or Pronominal 
—can no longer be attached directly to the verbal stem, but must be prefaced by the old preposition m ‘In’, 
Coptic n--, m-mo=. The Verbal Form is the Absolute Form.
§329. This form of the Object is here named the Oblique Object. The old term ‘Indirect Object’ is very 
confusing to the student, as it is a term also applied to the Dative as well as the Adverbial Phrase; e.g. ouon 
gar nim et.eire n-.m-.pe.qoou 3.moste m-.p.ouoein ‘For everyone who does what is evil, he hates the light’ 
(Jn 3:20), 5.`w m-mo.s ‘I say it’, ei.`w m-mo.s na.k ‘To thee I say it’, ne.3.tan6out m-mo.3 an nm-ma.u etbe 
`e ne.3.sooun- n-.ouon nim ‘He was not trusting himself to them, because he was knowing everyone’ (Jn 
2:24); cf also the examples quoted in §189, 194, 316. Note: An exception of this rule of Oblique Object with 
the Durative Tenses is found in the case of the verb ouw4 ‘T
  o desire, wish’
 
 ; e.g. 5.oue4 ou.na n-.6ouo 
euqusia ‘I desire mercy more than sacrifice’ (Mt 12:7) = ei.oue4 ou.na e.6oue ouqusia (Mt 9:13), 
e.u.oue4 n-.aspasmos ‘Desiring the salutations’ (Mk 12:38). With Relative Present; e.g. 6wb  2e  nim 
e.tetn.oua4.ou ‘Everything therefore which you wish them’ (Mt 7:12), n-.q.e e.t.e.oua4.s- ‘In the way 
which thou (fem) wishest it’ (Mt 26:39), ou pet.e.k.oua4.3- ‘What is it which thou desirest it?’ (Lk 18:41).
§329a. Observation: The reason for the use of the Oblique Object with the Durative Tenses is not yet 
clear. It may be that the imperfective aspect of the Durative Tenses led to the stress being laid on the verbal 
action. The fact that the verb must appear in the Absolute Form may have been due to the feeling that the 
verbal action so expressed was a process still in the state of being achieved and that the full result of the 
action was not yet realized in the object, the destined recipient of the action. On the other hand, the 
Limitative Tenses could use the Construct and Pronominal Forms where these existed, because it was felt 
that the verbal action had been or would be realized in the object. Thus the Object received the Tonal 
Stress, because it was considered as having received or destined to receive the full effect of the verbal 
action. However, the numerous instances of the use of the Oblique Object after the Limitative Tenses of 
verbs possessing both Construct and Pronominal Forms, suggest that the explanation advanced above is 
only a partial explanation. It is not impossible that when the Absolute Form was used after the Limitative 
Tenses, there was some feeling of emphasis on the verbal action which had been or would be effected.
§330. The majority of Greek and other loan verbs take the Oblique Object (§27n).  A smaller number follow 
the rule set out in the next section (§331).
§331. After some verbs, e.g. of sentient perception and mental action, the object is introduced by the 
preposition e-, ero= (§261.7). However, many of these verbs also take the Oblique Object.

‘To move’

‘To surround’
soo6e
‘To set up’

‘To meet’
4aar and 6ioue

strike me?’ (Jn 18:23), n-toou de n-.se.ouw4 an ekim ero.ou n-.oua n-.neu.thhbe ‘They, they do not wish to 
move them with one of their fingers’ (Mt 23:4).
§332a. Summary.
Direct Object (Verbal form, Construct or Pronominal):
     Admissible with all Limitative Tenses; exceptions:
          (1) Verbs lacking Construct or Pronominal Forms.
          (2) Greek and other loan words.
          (3) Verbs whose object must be introduced by e-, ero=.
Oblique Object (Verbal form, Absolute):
     A. Obligatory for all Durative Tenses; exceptions:
          (1) ouw4 ‘To desire, wish’.
          (2) Verbs whose Object must be introduced by e-, ero=.
     B. Admissible with Limitative Tenses.
Note: Compound Verbs (§177) used in Durative Tenses generally preserve the Construct Form of the verb; 
e.g. ne.u.r-.6ote gar 6ht.3- m-.p.laos ‘For they were fearing the people’ (Lk 22:2), tetn-.r.p.meeue gar 
ne.snhu m-.pen.6ise mn- pen.m-.ka6 e.n.r-.6wb m-.pe.6oou mn- te.u4h ‘For you remember, brethren, our 
suffering and our affliction while we worked (at our trade) day and night’ (I-Thes 2:9). As a rule the Object 
must be determined either outwardly or in itself. Compound Verbs, however, do not as a rule show the 
article before the noun following the Construct Form of the verb (§90). Exceptions to this rule are:
r-.p.wb4
‘To forget’
r-.p.meeue
‘To remember’
r-.p.ke
‘To be, do also’
Cf second example quoted in the Note above.
§333. Emphasis of the Object can be effected by placing it at the beginning of the sentence. Its normal 
position after the verb is referred to by means of a Resumptive Pronoun agreeing in number and gender; 
e.g. nai+ de n-te.re.3.meeue ero.ou ‘These things when he had thought on them’ (Mt 1:20), nai+ 
ere.p.`oeis aa.u na.i+ auw nai+ e.3.e.oua6.ou e`w.i+ ‘These things may the Lord do to me, and these 
things may he add to me’ (Ruth 1:17). When the object thus emphasized is a Pronoun, the Independent 
Pronoun is used at the beginning of the sentence; e.g. anok de a.u.kaqista m-mo.i+ n-.r-ro ebol 6i.toot.3- 
‘I have been set as king by him’ (lit. I, did they set me as king through him; Ps 2:6). Occasionally the Object is 
emphasized by placing the Interjection eis before it; e.g. eis nai+ oun-ta.i+.sou ‘Lo, these things, I have 
them’ (Z 310.b.4).
§334. The Adverb. The normal position of the Adverb or Adverbial Phrase is at the end of the sentence; 
e.g. a.p.soeit de moo4e etbhht.3- 6m-.ma nim n-.t.perixwros ‘The report proceeded concerning him in 
every place of the surrounding country’ (Lk 4:37), e.m-pat.ou.ka laau n-.6oun n-.6ht.3- ‘They had not yet laid 
anyone in it’ (Jn 19:41), ne3.maqhths m-p.ou.eime e.nai+ n-.4orp ‘His disciples did not perceive these things 
52

--- Page 53 ---
at first’ (Jn 12:16). Emphasis on the Adverb can always be effected by means of the Second Tenses (§186).
§335. However, there are many instances where the Adverb does in fact stand at the beginning of the 
sentence. Usually the Adverb or Adverbial Phrase is one denoting time. In the older stages of the language 
the Adverb of Time, especially if it were a date, could stand in this position; e.g. mn-.n-.sw.s de on 5.na.nau 
erw.tn- ‘Yet afterwards again I shall see you’ (Jn 16:22), 6n-.te.unou de et.m-mau a.3.telhl ‘Yet in that 
hour he rejoiced’ (Lk 10:21). When the Adverb refers to location, e.g. m-mau, emau, twn, etwn, etc., it does 
not stand at the beginning of the sentence, but rather must be preceded by a verbal form at least. Emphasis 
on an Adverb of Location can always be effected by means of the Second Tense; e.g. n-ta.p.`oeis 6wn m-
mau m-.pe3.smou ‘There the Lord commanded his blessing’ (Ps 133:3), ere.ne3.sn-te 6n-.n-.toou et.ouaab 
‘Upon the holy hills are his foundations’ (Ps 87:1). Adverbial Phrases indicating agent or instrument, which 
normally stand at the end of the sentence and can be stressed by means of Second Tenses, sometimes 
appear at the beginning of the sentence. The reason for this position is not so much a desire for emphasis, 
which could be obtained by the use of a Second Tense, as an attempt to imitate the word order of Greek 
originals; e.g.:
6n-.6a6  m-.meros  auw  6n-.6a6  n-.smot  e.a.p.noute  4a`e  mn-.nen.eiote  n-.4orp  6n-.ne.profhths
6n.qan  n-.nei.6oou  a.3.4a`e  nm-ma.n  6m-.p.4hre
πολυµερως και πολυτροπως παλαι ο θεος λαλησας τοις πατρασιν εν τοις προφηταις
επ εσχατου των ηµερων τουτων ελαλησεν ηµιν εν υιω
‘In many parts and in many manners, after God had spoken to our fathers of old by the prophets,
at the end of these days he has spoken to us in the Son’ (Heb 1:1-2a).
§336. Some Verbs and their Adverbs are so closely connected as to be almost compound verbal forms. This 
is particularly the case with many Verbs qualified by the Adverbs ebol, e6oun, e6rai+, e.pe.sht, e.rat3, 
etc. In such cases the Oblique Object must be used after the Adverb; e.g. n.se.na.swou6 e6oun 
n-.ne3.swtp ebol 6m- pe.3tou thu ‘They will gather in his chosen ones from the four winds’ (Mt 24:31), oun- 
4-.2om m-mo.i ebwl ebol m-.pe.rpe m-.p.noute ‘It is possible for me to destroy the temple of God’ (Mt 26:61). 
But Note: when the Dative is Pronominal it precedes the Adverb; e.g. a.p.noute ouwna6 na.3 ebol ‘God 
appeared to him’ (Z 303.d.3), e.3.ekw nh.tn- ebol n-.netn-.nobe ‘He may¹ forgive (to) you your sins’ (¹II-
Present, §336; Mk 11:26).
Chapter XV. Forms of Speech.
§337. Direct and Indirect Speech. Strictly speaking Coptic has no conception of Indirect Speech as shown 
in Latin or English, but rather treats both Direct and Indirect Speech in the same way. Indeed it is often 
quite impossible to distinguish whether a statement or a question following a verb of saying, answering or 
ordering, is Direct or Indirect Speech. The conjunction `e is used to introduce both Direct and 
Indirect Speech: in the case of Direct Speech, `e is not translated but rather is equivalent to inverted 
commas or quotation marks; with Indirect Speech, `e may be rendered as ‘That’ in statements and 
‘Whether’ in questions; e.g. pe`a.3 na.u `e n-.kotk-.2e n-.tetn-.m-ton m-mw.tn- ‘He said to them: Sleep 
therefore and rest yourselves’ (Mt 26:45), a.3.ouw4b- na.u `e a.i.ouw e.i.`w m-mo.s nh.tn- auw m-
pe.tn-.swtm- ‘He answered them: I have already told you (lit. I have ceased saying it to you) and you did not 
hear’ (Jn 9:27). Sometimes the verb of saying is omitted before `e; e.g. n-tere.3.swtm- `e t.galilaia 
‘When he heard (them say): Galilee’ (Lk 23:6). `e introducing indirect speech is mostly found after verbs of 
sentient perception or declaration; e.g. ne.s.soun de an `e i\s\ pe ‘Yet she was not understanding that it 
was Jesus’ (Jn 20:14), e.tm-.e.p.laau n-.rwme `e 3.`a6m ‘Not to count any man that he is unclean’ (Acts 
10:28), a.3.4ine `e e.ne.ou.galilaios pe prwme ‘He asked whether the man was a Galilean’ (Lk 23:6). 
Note: Occasionally `e- is found written `-; e.g. `.m-pr-.tre.[pei+].nobe ei ebol n-.toot.n ‘Do not let (this) 
sin come forth from us’ (Z 261.7).
§338. Coordination of Sentences. On the whole, Coptic preferred a series of short sentences rather than 
long involved sentences such as are common in Greek. Frequently a succession of short sentences appear 
without any connecting particles; e.g. n-tere.3.tw6m- de e.p.ro a.s.r-.ouw a.s.ouwn na.3 a.3.4ine n-.sa 
pes.eiwt ‘When he had knocked at the door, she replied; she opened (it) to him; he enquired after her 
father’ (Z 295.a.1). This type of asyndeton is also commonplace in the Semitic languages, although not 
characteristic of Greek. Continuity of verbal action in following sentences can be effected by means of the 
Conjunctive (§226). Not infrequently, the Conjunctive follows the Causative Infinitive; e.g. 6aps- etre.3.bwk 
e.6rai+ e.q.ierosoluma n.3-.4p.6a6 n-.6ise ebol 6itn- ne.presbuteros mn- n-.arxiereus mn- 
ne.grammateus n-.se.mouout m-mo.3 n.3-.twoun 6m-.p.me6.4omn-t n-.6oou ‘It is necessary for him to go up 
53

--- Page 54 ---
to Jerusalem; he will suffer much at the hands of the elders and the chief priests and the scribes; they will 
kill him; he will rise on the third day’ (Mt 16:21). For coordination by means of auw, cf §290.
§338a. Coptic freely incorporated many Greek Conjunctions (§288) in the language, especially in 
translations from Greek originals. Thus ΑΛΛΑ, ∆Ε, ΜΕΝ, ΓΕ, ΓΑΡ, ΟΥ∆Ε, ΚΑΙ, ΚΑΝ, ΕΤΕΙ, et cetera appear in 
Coptic MSS.
§339. Commands and Prohibitions. These are expressed by means of the Imperative (§238-41) and its 
Negation (§242). When the person or persons addressed are in the 3rd person, and also when some stress is 
implied in the command or prohibition, the III Future (§217) and its Negation (§218) are used.
§340. Wishes. Wishes are expressed by means of the Optative (§220); negative wishes by means of the 
Negation of the Optative (§221). When, however, the wish is more strongly expressed, the III Future (§217) 
or its Negation (§218) is used.
§341. Questions. Questions are expressed in three ways: (1) In the form of a statement, the interrogative 
nature of the sentence being indicated by the tone of voice or the context. (2) By means of an Interrogative 
Pronoun or Adverb. (3) By means of an Interrogative Particle (§346).
§342. (1) Questions in the form of an ordinary statement, the interrogative sense being indicated in 
speech by the tone of voice, and in writing by the context; e.g. n-tok pe p.sa6 m-.p.i\h\l\ auw n.t-.sooun an 
n-.nai+ ‘Art thou the teacher of Israel, and dost thou not know these things?’ (Jn 3:10), k.na.ka tek.yuxh 
6aro.i+ ‘Wilt thou lay down thy life for me?’ (Jn 13:38), a.u.`w m-mo.s `e tai+ te noemein ‘They said: Is this 
Naomi?’ (Ruth 1:19; see §191)
§343. (2) Questions containing an Interrogative Pronoun or Adverb. These sentences can be divided 
into two groups: (a) Questions in which the Interrogative Pronoun stands at the beginning of the sentence. 
(b) Questions in which the Interrogative Pronoun and Adverb stand after the verb:
§344. (a) The following interrogatives stand at the beginning of the sentence: a4, nim, a6ro=, etbe.ou, 
ouhr; ou can stand at the beginning of the sentence, but is more frequently found after the verb. The First 
Tenses of the Auxiliaries are usually employed after these interrogatives, as they already stand in the place 
of greatest stress.
(i) a4 ‘W
  ho?, what?, which?’
 
  can be used as a substantive, especially in Non-Verbal Sentences; e.g. a4 te 
q.e ‘Which is the way?’ (Z 298.b.1), a4 gar pet.motn e.`oo.s pe ‘For which is easier to say?’ (Mk 2:9). 
When a4 is used adjectivally it is linked to its noun by n-; e.g. a4 n-.ran ‘Which name?’, n-.a4 n-.6e 
k.na.`oo.s m-.pek.son ‘How (lit. In what way) wilt thou say to thy brother?’ (Lk 6:42), ou.a4 m-.mine.2e n-to3 
pe pai+ ‘(A) what kind (of man) therefore is this (one)?’ (Mk 4:41). Note: Occasionally a4 has the meaning of 
‘A
   certain’
 
 ; e.g. 6n- a4 n-.5me ‘In a certain town’.
(ii) nim ‘W
  ho?, what?, which?’
 
  is used in the same way as a4, with which it is often interchangeable. It is 
more commonly used with persons; e.g. nim n-tooun net.na.wn6- ‘Who then (are) those who will live?’ (Lk 
18:26), nim n-.rwme ebol n-.6ht.thutn- ‘Which man of you?’ (Lk 15:4). Note: In Non-Verbal Sentences 
containing an Independent Pronoun, nim follows the pronoun; e.g. n-te nim nto ‘Who art thou?’ (Ruth 3:9).
(iii) a6ro= ‘W
  hy?’
 
 , must always take a suffix pronoun referring to the subject of the question (it represents 
Greek τι or ινα τι); e.g. a6ro.k k.4a`e nm-ma.s ‘Why art thou speaking with her?’ (Jn 4:27), a6rw.tn- 
tetn-.moute ero.i+ `e p.`oeis ‘Why do you call me Lord?’ (Lk 6:46).
(iv) etbe.ou ‘W
  hy?’
 
  (lit. Concerning what?) as a substantive; e.g. etbe.ou a.u.take pai+ ‘Why did they 
destroy this?’ (Mt 26:8), etbe.ou m-pe.tn-.n-t.3- ‘Why have you not brought him?’ (Jn 7:45). Note: etbe.ou 
n-.6wb (lit. Concerning what thing?) usually follows the verb, which shows a Second Tense; e.g. e.tet.n-a.ei nm-
ma.i+ etbe.ou n-.6wb ‘For what purpose will you come with me?’ (Ruth 1:11), a.s.tamo.3 `e n-ta.s.`w6 
ero.3 etbe.ou n-.6wb ‘She showed him for what purpose she touched him’ (Lk 8:47).
(v) ouhr ‘H
  ow much/many?’
 
  is used adjectivally and is linked to its noun by n-; e.g. oun- ouhr n-.oeik n-
te.teutn- ‘How many loaves have you?’ (Mt 15:34), eis ouhr m-.rompe 5.askei ‘Lo, how many years do I 
practice self discipline?’ (Z 317.23).
(vi) aouhr ‘A
  bout how much/many?’
 
 ; e.g. eis aouhr n-.6oou n.`int a.u.3it.ou ‘Lo, about how many days 
since they carried them off?’ (Mor. 587.f.100v).
(vii) ou ‘W
  hat?’
 
  is mostly used as a substantive (§345b.i), and less frequently stands at the beginning of the 
sentence; e.g. ou pe p.maein ‘What is the sign?’ (Lk 21:7).
§345. (b) The following interrogatives stand after the verb, which shows a Second Tense (§186, second 
example):
(i) ou ‘W
  hat?’
 
  (see §344a.vii); e.g. ere.p.`oeis 2e ... na.r-.ou na.u ‘What therefore will the Lord ... do to 
them?’ (Lk 20:15), e.tetn-.r- ou n-.nei+.bir ‘What are you doing with these baskets?’ (Z 300.d.3).
(ii) twn ‘W
  here, whence?’
 
 ; e.g. e.u.na.`po m-.pe.x\s\ twn ‘Where will Christ be born?’ (lit. Where will they bring 
forth the Christ?; Mt 2:4), e.n.na.4p-.oeik twn ‘Where shall we buy bread?’ (Jn 6:5), n-ta.3.6e 2e e.n-.th2 twn 
54

--- Page 55 ---
‘Whence found it tares?’ (Mt 13:27). When the Subject is Nominal, twn is prefaced by the pronominal form of 
the Second Tense of the Present Auxiliary (§37), and the Nominal Subject follows without an introductory 
particle; e.g. e.3.twn p.r-ro n-.n-.ioudai ‘Where is the King of the Jews?’ (Mt 2:2).
(iii) e.twn ‘W
  hither?’
 
 ; e.g. ere.pai na.bwk e.twn ‘Whither will this man go?’ (Jn 7:35).
(iv) ebol.twn ‘W
  hence?’
 
  is mostly found with the Indefinite Article prefixed to form a substantive; e.g. 
ou.ebol.twn te tei.sofia ‘Whence is this wisdom?’
(v) tnau ‘W
  hen?’
 
  and its compound 4a.tnau ‘U
  ntil when?’
 
 ; e.g. ere.nai+ na.4wpe tnau ‘When will these 
things happen?’ (Lk 21:7). Note: 4a.tnau can stand at the beginning of the sentence, in which case the 
auxiliary shows a First Tense; e.g. 4a.tnau k.3i m-.pen.6ht ‘Until when art thou holding us in suspense (lit. 
taking our heart)?’ (Jn 10:24), 4a.tnau p.noute p.`a`e no2ne2 ‘Until when, O Lord, does the enemy mock?’ 
(Ps 74:10)
§346. (3) Questions introduced by an Interrogative Particle: (i) ene- (occasionally en-) stands at the 
beginning of the sentence, usually before the Subject, which often receives some stress in consequence; e.g. 
pe`a.3 m-.p.xiliarxos `e ene.sto na.i+ etra.`e (§357) ou.4a`e ero.k n-to3 de pe`a.3 `e 
ene.k.sooun m-.mn-t.ouei+enin ‘He says to the Chiliarch: Is it permitted to me to speak a word with thee? 
He said: Dost thou understand Greek?’ (Acts 21:37), ene.tare.n.ouw6 e.toot.n- e.bwk ebol e.mi4e 
mn-.beniamin ‘Are we to set ourselves to go out to fight with Benjamin?’ (Jud 20:28). ene- may be used 
before a Non-Verbal Sentence to stress the Predicate; e.g. ene.ou.galilaios pe p.rwme ‘Is the man a 
Galilean?’ (Lk 23:6). Likewise the stress may fall upon an adverbial phrase of time standing at the beginning 
of the sentence; e.g. en 6rai+ 6m-.pei.ouoei4 k.na.5 n-.t.mn-t.ero m-.p.i\h\l\ ‘Is it at this time thou wilt give 
the kingdom to Israel?’ (Acts 1:6). (ii) ei+e- (eeie-) introduces a question to which no definite answer is 
required. Its function is similar to the Greek αρα, so that ara is frequently used instead. ei+e- is often found 
at the beginning of the apodosis of a Conditional Sentence, with the meaning of ‘S
  urely, then of course’
 
  
(§376); e.g. ei+e p.moou nhu on 6m-.pe3.ouoei4 ‘Is the flood to come again in his time?’ (Z 347.16), ei+e 
ntok an 2e pe p.rm-.n-.khme ‘Art thou not therefore the Egyptian?’ (Acts 21:38), ara e.3.e.san4- n-.ou.5me 
‘Shall he nourish a village?’ (Z 340.5). Note: ara sometimes appears at the beginning of a question with 
another interrogative; e.g. ara a4 pe p.6wb n-.nai+ ‘What is the work of these?’ (Z 344.17). (iii) mh, 
sometimes mht(e)i, is used in questions to which a negative answer is expected; e.g. mh oun-.laau n-.tb-t n-
te.thutn ‘Have you any fish?’ (Jn 21:5), mhti anok pe ‘Is it I?’ (Mt 26:22). If the question already contains a 
negative, an affirmative answer is expected (cf Latin nonne); e.g. mh n-.s.na.`ere p.6hbs an ‘Will she not light 
the lamp?’ (Lk 15:8), mh oun.4-.2om n-.ou.bl-le e.`i.moeit 6ht.3-  n-.ou.bl-le mh n-.se.na.6e an e.u.6ieit 
m-.pe.snau ‘Is it possible for a blind man to lead a blind man?’ [Expects the answer ‘No’] ‘Will they not both fall 
into a ditch? [Expects the answer ‘Yes’]’ (Lk 6:39).
§347. Double Questions. (i) `n-- (`en- [in bad MSS `in-]) is used to link two questions; e.g. n-tok pet.nhu 
`n- e.n.na.2w4t- 6ht.3- n-.ke.oua ‘Art thou he who is about to come, or is it for another we shall look?’ (Lk 
7:20), `e p.`oeis e.k.`w na.n n-.tei+.parabolh `en e.k.`w m-mo.s e.ouon nim ‘(Peter said to him:) Lord, 
art thou saying this parable to us, or art thou saying it to everyone?’ (Lk 12:41). (ii) `n-.m-mon ‘O
  r not’
 
 ; e.g. 
ecesti e.5.khnsos m-.p.r-ro `n-.m-mon (other MSS `n-.ouk ecesti) ‘Is it lawful to give tribute to the king or 
not?’ (Mk 12:14).
§348. Questions are answered in the affirmative by e6e or se ‘Y
  es, verily’
 
 , and in the negative by m-mon 
‘N
  o’
  , m-pwr ‘B
  y no means’
 
  (§297); m-pe is used to deny questions relating to past events; e.g. pe`a.u na.3 
`e e6e p.`oeis ‘They say to him: Yes, Lord’ (Mt 13:51), pe`a.i+ na.u `e se ‘I say to them: Yes’ (Z 347.17), 
a.u.ouw4b- na.3 `e m-mon ‘They answered him: No’ (Jn 21:5), mh  a.tetn-.4wpe n-.at.laau n-to.ou de 
pe`a.u `e m-pe ‘Were you without anything? They say: No’ (Lk 22:35).
§349. Indirect Questions. As in the case of the Indirect Statement (§337), it is often difficult to decide if a 
question is in fact direct or indirect; e.g. ma`ne n.ent.a.u.swtm- `e ou n.ent.a.i+.`oo.u na.u ‘Ask those 
who heard what were the things I said to them’ (Jn 18:21; §360). Note: This construction is usual after 
sooun- ‘To understand’ in order to amplify the Object; e.g. pai+ tn-.sooun- m-mo.3 `e ou.ebwl.twn pe ‘This 
one we know (of him) whence he is’ (Jn 7:27), a.3.souwn.3- `e nim pe ‘He knew (him) who he was’ (Z 
304.g.3).
§350. Relative Clauses. The relative clause plays an extremely important part in Coptic, for by means of it 
the deficiency in adjectives and the lack of the participle are made good. Relative clauses can be divided into 
two main types: (1) With undefined antecedent. (2) With defined antecedent. A subdivision of both these 
types must further be made: (a) When the antecedent is also the subject of the relative clause. (b) When 
the antecedent is not the subject of the relative clause.
§351. (1) With Undefined Antecedent: When the antecedent is without the article, or has the indefinite 
55

--- Page 56 ---
article, the relative clause is introduced by the Circumstantial Tense or a compound tense prefixed by e- 
(§231); e.g. ou.polis e.sta.`rhu ‘A city which is strong’ (Ps 30:22), 6en.et.pw e.u.6or4 ‘Burdens which 
are heavy’ (Mt 23:4), ne.3.gramateus pe e.4a.3.s6ai n-.sa pe.souo ‘He was a scribe who used to keep 
account of the corn’ (Z 350.d.1), ou.stasis e.a.s.4wpe 6n-.t.polis ‘An insurrection which had happened 
in the city’ (Lk 23:19), m-mn-.6m6al e.naa.3 e.ne3.`oeis ‘There is not (a) servant who is greater than his 
Lord’ (Jn 15:20).
§352. When the relative clause is non-verbal, the usage is as noted in §197a.n. (a) ere- is used when the 
subject of the relative clause is nominal and differs from the antecedent and the predicate is adverbial 
(§301ff); e.g. ou.rwme ere.ou.4o4ou m-.moou 6i`w.3 ‘A man upon whom is a pitcher of water’ (Mk 14:13), 
ou.4eere ... ere.ou.p\n\a\ n-.akaqarton nm-ma.s ‘A daughter ... in whom was an unclean spirit’ (Mk 7:25). (b) 
e- is used before non-verbal clauses of the 2nd group (§306ff); e.g. ne.un ou.rwme de n-.rm.mao e.pe3.ran 
pe nineuh ‘There was a rich man whose name was Nineve [sic]’ (Lk 16:19), eis ou.s6ime ... e.u.re3.r-.nobe 
te ‘Lo, a woman ... who (was) a sinner’ (Lk 7:37).
§353. When the antecedent is not the subject of the relative clause, it must be referred back to by means of 
a resumptive pronoun. This rule applies equally when the antecedent is defined (but cf §364 for an exception 
to this rule); e.g. ou.ma e.u.moute ero.3 `e liqostrwton ‘A place which they call it: Lithostraton’ (Jn 
19:13), ne.un ou.rwme de m-mau ere.te3.2i` 4ouwou (§233 & 233n) ‘There was a man there whose hand 
was dried (lit. a man who his hand is dried;)’ (Mk 3:1), a.3.smine n-.ou.6oou e.3.na.krine n-.6ht.3- 
n-.t.oikoumenh ‘He has appointed a day on which he will judge the world (lit. a day which he will judge in it the 
world)’ (Acts 17:31).
§354. Negation of relative clauses with undefined antecedent. e- is prefixed to the negative particle n- 
(§198) or to the negative auxiliary; e.g. 6n-.ou.6oou e.n-.3.sooun m-mo.3 an auw 6n-.ou.ounou e.n.3-.eime 
ero.s an ‘In a day which he does not understand and in an hour which he does not perceive’ (Lk 12:46), 
ou.sate e.me.sw4m- ‘A fire which is not wont to be quenched’ (Mt 3:12; §205), ou.no2 n-.qliyis e.m-
pe.ouon n-.te.s6h 4wpe `in te.6oueite m-.p.kosmos ‘A great tribulation, the like of which has not 
happened since the beginning of the world’ (Mt 24:21), ou.tafos n-.br-re e.m-pat.ou.ka.laau n-.6oun 
n-.6ht.3- ‘A new tomb in which they had not yet laid anyone’ (Jn 19:41; §222). Note: Sometimes, in badly 
written MSS, e- is omitted before a sonant consonant; e.g. ou.sno3 m-pw.3 (for e.m-pw.3) an pe ‘A blood which 
is not his own’ (Heb 9:25).
§355. (2) With Defined Antecedent: When the antecedent is defined, the particle et- is used to link 
the relative clause to the word it qualifies. The relative clause follows the construction of an ordinary 
statement, the particle et- indicating its syntactical function.
§356. et- is used to introduce the relative clauses making an affirmative statement when the subject of the 
relative clause is the same as the antecedent. Note: This rule does not apply in the case of affirmative 
statements which contain the Imperfect or Tense of Habitude (§359), or the Perfect tense (§360). The use of 
et- and the Qualitative is particularly common in forming the equivalent of adjectives or participles; 
e.g. p.p\n\a\ et.ouaab ‘The Holy Spirit’ (lit. The Spirit who [is] Holy), p.4hn et.rht 6i`n- m-.ma n-.6ate ‘The tree 
sprouting beside the water channels’ (Ps 1:3). (a) et-Present Tense; e.g. naiat.ou n-.n-.bal et.nau ‘Blessed 
(are) the eyes which see’ (Lk 10:23). (b) et-Future Tense; e.g. pai+ et.na.moone m-.pa.laos ‘This one who 
will shepherd my people’ (Mt 2:6). (c) et-Old Conjugation (§180); e.g. p.mhh4e et.na4w.3 ‘The crowd 
which was much’ (Lk 7:11). (d) et-Adverbial Phrase; e.g. p.koui et.n-.6ht.ou ‘The little one who (is) in 
their midst’ (Lk 15:12), et.m-mau ‘That one’ (§54).
§357. When the subject of the relative clause differs from the antecedent, the subject, if nominal, is 
prefixed by the form etere-. Reference to the antecedent is made by means of a resumptive pronoun 
(§353); e.g. i\s\ pai+ etere.paulos kurisce m-mo.3 ‘Jesus, this one whom Paul preaches him’ (Acts 19:13), 
m-.p.ma etere.ne3.maqhths soou6 n-.6ht.3- ‘In the place in which his disciples are gathering together’ (Jn 
20:19), p.ma gar etere.pek.a6o na.4wpe n-.6ht.3- ‘For the place in which thy treasure will be’ (Mt 6:21).
§358. But, when the subject of the relative clause is Pronominal, the following forms are used:
Person
 
Future
 1 com
 e5.-
 et.n-
 e5.na-
 et.n-na-
 2 masc
 et.k--
 et.etn--
 et.k-.na-
 
 2 fem
 et.e-
etc.
 3 masc
 et.3--
 et.ou-
 3 fem
 et.s--
56

--- Page 57 ---
It should be noted that the Present Relative, like the Durative tenses, cannot take a direct object (§328; an 
exception is noted in §329n); e.g. pai+ e5.swtm- e.nai+ etbhh.3 ‘This one concerning whom I hear these things’ 
(Lk 9:9; §274), te.spire et.ou.moute ero.s `e t.6italikh ‘The company which they call: The Italian’ 
(Acts 10:1), p.oeik de e5.na.taa.3 ‘The bread which I shall give’ (Jn 6:51).
§359. When the relative clause contains either the Durative Imperfect (§194) or the Limitative Tense of 
Habitude (§204), the same form is used after the defined antecedent as after the undefined antecedent 
(§351); e.g. p.ma enere.p.4hre 4hm n-.6ht.3 ‘The place where the young child was’ (Mt 2:9), p.4oei4 
e.4are.p.thu qlo.3 ebol ‘The dust which the wind is wont to scatter’ (Ps 1:4). Note: ete.4are- is 
sometimes found; e.g. te.skhnh  ... ete.4a.u moute ero.s `e pet.ouaab n-.net.ouaab ‘The tent ... which 
they are wont to call: The Holy of the Holies’ (Heb 9:3).
§360. Before the Perfect Tense, the Relative Particle appears as ent- (thus ent.a-, etc.), less correctly 
written n-t-. However, it is occasionally written et-, which is the regular form in Bohairic; e.g. anok pe 
p.oeik et.on6 ent.a.3.ei ebol 6n-.t.pe ‘I Am the living bread which has come down from heaven’ (Jn 
6:51), pa.esoou n-t.a.3.swrm- ‘My sheep which has gone astray’ (Lk 15:6), p.rwme de ent.a.n-.daimonion 
ei ebol n-.6ht.3- ‘The man out of whom the demons came’ (Lk 8:38).
§361. When the relative clause contains a negative statement, the Negative Particle n-- or the Negative 
Auxiliaries m-pe- and mere- (§199a) are prefaced by the verbal prefix e-; e.g. p.`ai.beke ete.n-.ou.4ws an 
pe pai+ ete.n-.nou.3 an ne n-e.soou ‘The hireling who is not a shepherd, this one whose own the sheep are 
not’ (Jn 10:12), 4hn.2e nim ete.n.3-.na.taue karpos an ‘Every tree therefore which will not bring forth 
fruit’ (Mt 7:19), ne.6bhte ... ete.m-pe.ke.oua aa.u ‘The works ... which another has not done’ (Jn 15:24), 
n-.eidwlon ete.me.u.4a`e ‘The idols which are not wont to speak’ (I-Cor 12:2). Note 1: Sometimes, 
particularly after pai+ ‘This one’, the relative particle et- falls away before the negative, and a form exactly 
the same as that used after the undefined antecedent follows; e.g. pai+ e.n.3-.me an  m-.pe3.son ‘This one 
who does not love his brother’ (I-Jn 3:14), pai+ e.n.5.m-p.4a an n-.3i 6a.pe3.tooue ‘This one whose shoe I 
am not worthy to bear’ (Mt 3:11). Note 2: Occasionally ete.m-pe- is used in an interrogative sense; e.g. 
ete.m-p.ou.swtm- ‘Did they not hear?’ (Rom 10:18), ete.m-pe.p.israhl (variant reading e.ne.m-pe.p.i\h\l\) eime 
‘Did Israel not perceive?’ (ibid., verse 19).
§362. The same construction, et.e-, holds good: (a) when the relative clause contains the impersonal 
existential verbs oun-- or (m-)mn-- (§184); e.g. p.`oeis et.e.oun-.2om m-mo.3 ‘The Lord in whom is strength’ 
(Ps 23:8), p.ma et.e.mn-.6a6 n-.ka6 n-.6ht.3- ‘The place in which there is not much earth’ (Mk 4:5).
§363. Or (b) when the relative clause contains a Non-Verbal sentence of the Second Group (i.e. containing 
pe, te or ne; §306); e.g. t.pugh m-.moou et.e.p.swma pe mn-.pes.no3 m-.p.`oeis ‘The fountain of water 
which is the body with his blood of the Lord’ (Z 320.a.4).
§364. Remarks on the Relative Clause. The resumptive pronoun is omitted when the antecedent is an 
adverbial expression of time, place or manner; e.g. `in p.nau de n-ta.i+.`i n-.ta.s6ime ‘Since the hour in 
which I took my wife’ (Z 346.b.18), a.3.ei.2e on e.t.kana ... p.ma enta.3.tre.p.moou r-.hrp ‘He came 
therefore again to Cana,... the place in which he caused the water to be made wine’ (Jn 4:46), kata q.e n-
ta.3.5.sbw nh.tn- ‘According to the way in which he has instructed you’ (I-Jn 2:26).
§365. When a defined antecedent is qualified by several consecutive relative clauses, as a rule only the first 
relative clause is prefaced by the particle et-; e.g. naiat.3 m-.p.rwme et.e.m-p.3-.bwk 6m-.p.4o`ne 
n-.n-.asebhs e.mt.3-.a6erat.3- 6i te.6ih n-.n-.re3.r-.nobe e.m-p.3.6moos 6i t.kaqedra n-.n-.loimos ‘Blessed is 
the man who has not gone in the counsel of the wicked, who has not stood in the way of sinners, who has 
not sat in the seat of the scornful’ (Ps 1:1).
§366. It is to be noted that when the Relative Clause was used in a descriptive sense, the following 
constructions were employed: (1) The antecedent is undefined and the Relative Clause in introduced by et,- 
equivalent to ‘N  amely, viz.
 
 ’ (§294.6.a); e.g. 6en.sa6 et.e.barnabas pe mn-.shmewn ‘Teachers, namely 
Barnabas and Simeon’ (Acts 13:1). (2) The antecedent is either defined or undefined, and the pronouns pai+, 
tai+, nai+, are inserted between the antecedent and the Relative Clause; e.g. mh n-to.k naa.k e.pen.eiwt 
iakwb pai+ ent.a.3.5 na.n n-.t.4wte ‘Art thou greater than our father Jacob, this one who gave us the 
well?’ (Jn 4:12), t.magdalhnh tai+ ent.a.sa43- n-.daimonion ei ebol n-.6ht.s- ‘The Magdalene, this one out 
of whom came forth seven devils’ (Lk 8:2), ou.rwme n-.rm-.mao pai+ ent.a.3.ei ebol e.6tooue e.qne 
n-.ergaths ‘A rich man, this one who came out at morning to hire workers’ (Mt 20:1).
§367. When the relative clause is preceded by a non-verbal sentence containing pe, te, ne, contraction 
with et- usually occurs:
pe et-
becomes
pet-
57

--- Page 58 ---
te et-
becomes
tet-
ne et-
becomes
net-
Though this form is morphologically identical with the relative substantive (§368), it can be distinguished 
from it by reference to the preceding sentence which must be non-verbal; e.g. nim  pet.`w [pe et.`w] m-
mo.s ne ‘Who is it who is speaking to thee?’ (Jn 4:10), nai+ ne5.6wn [ne e5.6wn] m-mo.ou et.e.thutn- ‘These 
are those which I am ordering you’ (Jn 15:17).
§368. The Relative Substantive. By prefixing the Definite Article, the Relative Clause can become the 
equivalent of a substantive; e.g. pet.m-mau ‘That one’, pet.4ine ‘The seeker’ (lit. The [one] who seeks), 
pet.e.n.3-.me an m-mo.i+ ‘The one who does not love me’ (Jn 14:24), pet.k.na.mor.3- 6i `m-.p.ka6 ‘That which 
thou wilt bind on earth’ (Mt 16:19). As a substantive it can be used as a subject, object or adverb of a 
sentence; e.g. peq.b-bio de m-mo.3 se.na.`ast.3- ‘The one who humbles himself will be exalted’ (Lk 18:14), 
5.5.m-.p.re.mht n-.ne5.`po m-mo.ou thr.ou ‘I give the tenth of all that I acquire’ (Lk 18:12), e.r-.pe5.oua4.3- 
6n-.net.e.nou.i ne ‘To do what I wish with mine own’ (Mt 20:15). Long usage made some relative 
substantives equivalent to undefined nouns; e.g. peq.oou (pet.6oou) ‘The evil’, pet.nanou.3 ‘The good’; 
e.g. a.alecandros f.am.kl-le r-.6a6 na i+.  m-.peq.oou ‘Alexander the smith did me much evil’ (II-Tim 4:14). 
These substantives, although in fact they already possessed the Definite Article, could take a second 
Article, Definite or Indefinite, or could prefix the Possessive Adjective; e.g. p.pet.ouaab ‘The holy 
one, the saint’ (lit. The the-one-who holy), a.u.twwbe na.i+ n-.6en.peq.oou e.p.ma n-.6en.pet.nanou.ou ‘They 
requite to me evil instead of good’ (Ps 34:12), pek.pet.ouaab ‘Thy holy one’ (Ps 16:10).
Chapter XVI. Adverbial Clauses.
§369. I. Final Clauses. Final clauses can be expressed in their simplest form by means of the Infinitive 
(§251) or the Causative Infinitive (§256) placed after the main verb, both forms being prefaced by the 
preposition e-; e.g. a.3.twoun e.w4 ‘He rose in order to read’ (Lk 4:16), a.u.moo4e 6n-.te.6ih 
etre.u.kto.ou e6rai+ e.p.ka6 n-.i+ouda ‘They proceeded in the way in order that they should return to the 
land of Judah’ (Ruth 1:7).
§370. The Clause can be introduced by the conjunction `e or its compound `eka(a)s, followed by the III 
Future, less frequently by the II Future (§199a); e.g. a.u.sepswp.3 `ekas e.3.e.tal e.toot.3- e`w.3 
‘They besought him that he should place his hand on him’ (Mk 7:32), e.n.na.4p-.oeik twn `e e.r.e.nai+ 
na.ouwm ‘Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?’ (Jn 6:5), a.3.6wn de e.toot.ou `ekas n-
ne.u.`oo.s e.laau ‘He ordered them that they should not say it to anyone’ (Mk 7:36).
§371. The Greek conjunctions 6wste, mhpws, mhpote, usually followed by the Conjunctive, can be used to 
introduce a Final Clause (§229).
§372. The conjunctive without introductory conjunction, to express purpose (§226c).
§373. II. Causal Clauses. Causal clauses are introduced by the conjunction `e, or its compounds ebol.`e 
and etbe.`e (for ebol an `e, §396.1.a); e.g. 5.4p-.6mot n-.toot.k- `e 5.o an n-.q.e m-.p.ke.seepe n-.n-.rwme 
‘I thank Thee because I am not like the rest of men’ (Lk 18:11), kte.thutn- na.4eere n-.tetn-.bwk `e 
a.i+.r.6llw ‘Return, my daughters, and go, because I have become an old woman’ (Ruth 1:12), ebol.`e 
ne.t.paraskeuh te ‘Because it was the Day of Preparation’ (Jn 19:31), pe`a.u na.3 `e etbe.`e m-pe.laau 
q no
.
.n (t 6no
.
.n) ‘They said to him: Because no one has hired us’ (Mt 20:7). Sometimes appear the Greek 
conjunctions epei, ep(e)idh; e.g. epeidh gar n-ta.p.mou 4wpe ebol 6itn- ou.rwme ‘For because through 
man death has come into being’ (I-Cor 15:21).
§374. III. Conditional Clauses. Conditional clauses can be divided into two main groups: Real Conditions, 
and Irreal Conditions. The former group must be further divided into Open Conditions and Prospective 
Conditions.
§375. A. Real Conditional Clauses: (1) Open: Conditions in which nothing is implied as to the 
fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the supposition. The Protasis is introduced by e4`e (represents Greek ει), and 
is followed by the Auxiliary of the Present, the Perfect, and less frequently the Future; e.g. e4`e pek.bal 
de  n-.ounam skandalize m-mo.k pork.3- ng-.no`.3- n-.sa n-.bol m-mo.k ‘If thy right eye is offending thee, pluck 
it out and cast it from thee’ (Mt 5:29), e4`e a.u.moute e.p.`oeis `e beelzeboul posw mallon 
ne3.rm-.n-.hi+ ‘If they have called the Lord: Beelzebul, how much more his domestics?’ (Mt 10:25), e4`e m-
p.i+.4.2m-.2om e.twoun 6a.p.no2ne2 n-.ta.maau ‘If I have not been able to bear the reproach of my 
mother’ (Z 289.a.6).
§376. Often the Apodosis is introduced by the particle eie (eeie) ‘T
  hen’
 
 ; e.g. e4`e anok de 
e.i.ne`.daimonion ebol 6n-.p.p\n-a\ m-.p.noute eie a.s.pw6 e.6rai+ e`w.tn- n-2i t.mn-t.ero m-.p.noute ‘If I 
58

--- Page 59 ---
by the Spirit of God am casting out devils, then the Kingdom of Heaven has come upon you’ (Mt 12:28), 
e4`e k.na.no`.n- ebol eie ma.`oou.n- e6oun e.ta.gelh n-.ne.4au ‘If thou wilt cast us out, then send us 
into the herd of swine’ (Mt 8:31).
§377. (2) Prospective: Conditions in which the fulfillment of the supposition contained in the protasis is 
regarded as being reasonably likely. The protasis in introduced by the auxiliary of the II Present followed 
by the particle 4an- and the verbal form er4an- (represents the Greek εαν). It is to be noted that the form 
e.r.e.4an-, which would normally be expected before the Nominal Subject or with the 2 fem sing pronoun 
(§199a), is only found in archaic texts; e.g. er4an pe.6mou de baabe e.u.na.mol6.3- n-.ou ‘If the salt shall 
become insipid, with what shall they salt it?’ (Mt 5:13), er4an `o6 m-.mate e.p.top n-.te3.4thn 
5.na.tou`a.i ‘If I shall touch only the fringe of his garment, I shall become whole’ (Mt 9:21).
§378. Negation of this form of the Prospective Conditional is effected by the particle tm-- placed before the 
Infinitive; e.g. e.n.4an.tm-.ouwm n-.tn-.na.4wwt an ‘If we shall not eat, we shall not be in want’ (I-Cor 8:8). 
But as a general rule, the particle 4an- is omitted; e.g. e.tetn-.4an.kw gar ebol n-.n-.rwme n-.neu.nobe ... 
e.tetn-.tm-.kw de ebol ‘If you shall forgive men their sins,... if you shall not forgive’ (Mt 6:14-15).
§379. The prospective conditional may be introduced by e4wpe, especially if the Protasis is Non-Verbal. 
When the Protasis contains a future supposition, e4wpe is usually followed by er4an-; e.g. e4wpe 2e 
pek.bal ou.6aplous pe ‘If thy eye is sound’ (Mt 6:22), e4wpe p.hi+ m-.p.4a mare.tetn.eirhnh ei e6rai 
e`w.3 ‘If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it’ (Mt 10:12), e4wpe de e.tetn-.4an.6e ero.3 
ma.tamo.i+ ‘If you shall find him, inform me’ (Mt 2:8). Note: e4wpe m-mon renders ‘O
  therwise’
 
 ; e.g. 
me.u.ne` m-ris e.6wt n-.as e4wpe m-mon 4a.u.pw6 n-.2in-.6wt ‘They are not wont to put new wine into old 
skins; otherwise the skins become rent’ (Mt 9:17; §63c).
§380. B. Irreal Conditional Clauses. When the supposition contained in the Protasis is clearly impossible 
of fulfillment, it is introduced by the verbal prefix ene-. The Protasis may be Non-Verbal, or contain the 
Imperfect or II Perfect tenses. The Apodosis usually contains the Future Imperfect, less frequently the 
Imperfect. Note: The form of the Imperfect tense in the Protasis, owing to contraction, presents the curious 
appearance of a Present tense with the prefix ene-; e.g. ene.ou.profhths pe pai ne.3.na.eime `e ou te 
‘If this one were a prophet, he would perceive what she is’ (Lk 7:39), ene.tetn-.pisteue gar e.mwushs 
ne.tet.n-a.pisteue ero.i+ pe ‘For if you were believing Moses, you would believe me’ (Jn 5:46), ene.n-
ta.u.souwn.s- gar ne.u.na.s5ro\u\ an pe m-.p.`oeis m-.pe.oou ‘For if they had understood it, they would not 
have crucified the Lord of Glory’ (I-Cor 2:8).
§381. Sometimes the particle e4`pe introduces the Apodosis; e.g. ene.nta.n-.2om enta.u. 4wpe 
n-.6ht.thutn- 4wpe 6n- turos mn- sidwn e4`pe a.u.metanoei 6n-.ou.2ooune mn- ou.kr-mes ‘If the mighty 
works which have happened among you, had happened in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented in 
sackcloth and ashes’ (Mt 11:21).
§382. Remarks on the Conditional Clause. As a general rule the Protasis precedes the Apodosis. The 
exceptions which occur are no doubt due to the desire to retain as far as possible the word order of Greek 
originals; e.g. mare.3.tou`o.3 e4`e a.3.oua4.3- ‘Let him deliver him, if he has desired him’ (Ps 22:8).
§383. ‘E
  xcept, unless’
 
  is rendered by the compound conjunction n-.sabhl `e; e.g. n-.sabhl `e a.p.`oeis 
bohqei ero.i+ para ou.koui+ a.ta.yuxh ouw6 6n- amn-te ‘Unless the Lord had helped me, in a little (time) 
my soul had dwelt in Sheol’ (Ps 94:17); or by means of the Greek ei-mh-ti followed by the conjunctive; e.g. 
m-mn-.4.2om n-.laau e.ei 4aro.i+ ei-mh-ti n-te.pa.eiwt e.nta.3.tauoi swk m-mo.3 ‘It is not possible for 
anyone to come to me, except My Father who sent me draws him’ (Jn 6:44).
§384. The Conditional Clause sometimes renders a concessive meaning. In fact, the Concessive Clause is a 
variation of the Conditional, but with the difference that the supposition of the Protasis is regarded as 
conceded. In this sense Coptic occasionally uses e4`e; e.g. e4`e p.noute n-.5.r-.6ote 6ht.3- an ‘Although I 
do not fear God’ (Lk 18:4), e4`e a.i.r-.ke¹.lupei m-mw.tn- 6n-.t.epistolh ‘Although I made you very¹ sorry 
by the letter’ (II-Cor 7:8; ¹Crum 84a). But as a rule Coptic employed the Greek conjunctions ka-n (και εαν) 
followed by er4an ‘  And if, even if, if only’
 
 , kai-per ‘  Since, although’
 
 , and kai-toi ‘  And yet, since’
 
 ; e.g. 
ka-n e.s.4an.4wpe e.tra¹.mou nm-ma.k n-.5.na.aparna m-mo.k an ‘Although it should happen for me to be 
put to death with thee, I shall not deny thee’ (Mt 26:35; ¹§243.3), kai-per e.nta.u.ei ebol 6n-.t.5pe 
n-.abra6am ‘Although they have come forth from the loins of Abraham’ (Heb 7:5).
§385. IV. Temporal Clauses: (a) Temporal clauses can be expressed by the Circumstantial tenses (§197, 
212). In these clauses the time standpoint is determined by the tense of the verb in the main 
sentence. The clause can stand before or after the main sentence.
§386. (b) Temporal clauses with a specific reference to a point in time can be expressed in terms of 
Past (i.e. completed action), Contemporaneous, or Prospective Action. Such clauses, expressing themselves in 
59

--- Page 60 ---
a particular time standpoint, generally but not invariably (§388n) precede the main sentence.
§387. Past Temporal Clauses.

n-tere-
The auxiliary n-tere- is used to express action completed prior to the action of the verb of the main 
sentence; e.g. n-tere.noemin de nau `e a.s.ta`ros e.moo4e nm-ma.s a.s.lo e.s.4a`e nm-ma.s 
e.pei.6wb ‘When Naomi had seen that she was determined to proceed with her, she ceased to speak to her 
concerning this matter’ (Ru 1:18), n-ter.ou.ei e6oun e.bhqleem ... a.p.soit.swr ebol ‘When they had 
entered Bethlehem ... the report spread’ (Ruth 1:19). Negation of the Past Temporal is effected by means of 
tm--; e.g. n-ter.ou.tm-.e.4.2m-.2om de e.`it.3- na.3 e6oun ‘When they had not been able to take him in to 
him’ (Mk 2:4).
§388. `in- ‘F
  rom’
 
 , followed by the II Perfect, refers back to action completed in the past, and renders 
‘S
  ince’
 
  (Note: `in.n-ta- contracts to `i.nta-); e.g. eis aouhr n-.ou.oei4 `i.nta.pai ta6o.3 ‘Lo, about how 
long since this had seized him?’ (Mk 9:21), p.me6.4omn-t n-.6oou pe p.oou `i.nta.nai 4wpe ‘It is the third 
day since these things have happened’ (Lk 24:21). Note: Clauses containing `i.nta- do not conform to the 
rule that the temporal clauses, other than those containing the Circumstantial tense, generally precede the 
main sentence.
§389. For mn-n-sa+the Causative Infinitive ‘After’, see §257. In contrast to the temporal clause introduced 
by the Past Temporal n-tere- (§387)— which, to some extent at least, stresses the fact that an action has 
been completed in the past— mn-n_sa+the Causative Infinitive indicates the event itself which thus 
happened in the past. It might be described as a Dating Clause; e.g. mn-n-sa t.re3.mou n-2i mwushs ‘After 
the death of Moses’ (Josh 1:1).
§390. For e.a- and e.m-p- to express temporal clauses, cf §231.
§391. Contemporaneous Temporal Clauses. As noted in §197, the Circumstantial Tense is normally used 
to express contemporaneous action. Prefaced by `in-, it expresses the meaning ‘W
  hile yet’
 
 ; e.g. 
pei.planos a.3.`oo.s `in.e.3.on6- `e 5.na.twoun mn-.n-.sa 4omn-t n-.6oou ‘This deceiver said, while he 
was yet alive, I shall rise after three days’ (Mt 27:63). The Greek conjunctions 6ws ‘As’, 6oson ‘As long as’, 
efoson ‘As long as, insofar as’, eti ‘Yet, still’, can also precede the Circumstantial Tense to render the 
meaning ‘W
  hile, as’
 
 . But it is to be noted that these conjunctions can stand before other auxiliaries and 
before the Non-Verbal sentence; e.g. 6oson ere.pa t
. .4eleet 4oop nm-ma.u ‘As long as the bridegroom is 
with them’ (Mk 2:19), 6oson 5.6m-.p.kosmos ‘As long as I (am) in the world’ (Jn 9:5).
§392. For 6m-.p.tre-  ‘When, while, as’, see §258. The syntactical function of this adverbial compound is 
similar to that of the Causative infinitive prefaced by mn-.n-.sa, the essential difference being that the event 
referred to is contemporaneous with the action of the main sentence; e.g. 6m-.p.tre.u.n-kotk- de n-2i 
n-.rwme a.3.ei n-2i pe3.`a`e ‘During (the time that) the men were sleeping, his enemy came’ (Mt 13:25).
§393. Prospective Temporal Clauses. er4an- (§377) introduces the Prospective Temporal Clause as well 
as the Prospective Conditional. Context alone must in many cases decide whether a temporal or a 
conditional meaning is implied. Sometimes the main sentence contains the Greek tote ‘T
  hen’
 
 , which 
decides the temporal nature of the preceding clause; e.g. er4an pe.x\s\ ouwn6 ebol ete.pen.wn6 pe tote 
6wt.thutn- tet.na.ouwn6- ebol nm-ma.3 6n-.ou.eoou ‘When Christ who is our life will appear, then you will 
also appear with Him in glory’ (Col 3:4). The Greek conjunction 6otan ‘W
  henever’
 
  can introduce temporal 
clauses with er4an-; e.g. 6otan ete.tn-.4an `ise m-.p.4hre m-.p.rwme tote tet.na.eime `e anok pe 
‘When you will be raising up the Son of Mankind, then you will perceive that I Am’ (Jn 8:28).
§394. The Circumstantial Tense (§188) can often express a temporal clause with reference to the future; 
e.g. e.tetn.ei de e.tetn.a.4lhl n-ne¹.tn-.4wpe n-.q.e n-.n-.6upokriths ‘When you come, being about to 
pray, do not by any means become as the hypocrites’ (Mt 6:5; ¹III Fut Neg, §199a).
§395. The Tenses of Unfulfilled Action, 4ant- and m-pat- (§222), can be used in Prospective Temporal 
Clauses; e.g. mh e.tetn-.a2w e.tetn-.2w4t 6ht.ou 4ant.ou.r-.no2 ‘Will you continue looking for them 
60

--- Page 61 ---
until they are grown up?’ (Ruth 1:13), e.m-pate.ou.alektwr moute k.na.aparna m-mo.i+ n-.4omn-t n.sop 
‘Before a cock has crowed thou wilt deny me three times’ (Mt 26:34).
§396. Negation. Coptic employs three methods of negation:
(1) n- ... an
(2) Negative Auxiliaries 
(3) tm--
(1) n- ... an; These particles are used to negate: (a) Single words and prepositional phrases; e.g. n-.q.e an 
n-.neu.grammateus ‘Not as their scribes’ (Mt 7:29), 6n-.ou.tb-bo an ‘Not humbly’ (Phil 1:17), ebol an `e 
pe3.roou4 pe 6a.n-.6hke ‘Not because his concern is for the poor’ (Jn 12:6). (b) Non-verbal sentences 
(§312). (c) The Old Conjugation verbs (§182ff.); e.g. n-.nanou petn-.4ou4ou an ‘Your boasting is not good’ 
(I-Cor 5:6). (d) The Auxiliaries of I Present (§193), Imperfect (§196), Circumstantial (§198), I Future (§213), 
Future Imperfect (§215). (e) The Second Tenses: Present (§193), Perfect (§203), Habitude (§207), Future 
(§213). (f) In relative clauses (§354, 361). Note 1: The first particle n- is frequently omitted (§193, 196, 203), 
also before Old Conjugation verbs (§182). Note 2: an is placed immediately after the word in the sentence 
which is to be negated.
§397. Examples of Negation of the Qualitative are not common. As was the case in the older stages 
of the Egyptian language, so also in Coptic there is a marked hesitation to deny a state. Thus Coptic writes m-
p.s-.mou ‘She has not died’ (Mk 5:39) rather than n.s-.moout an ‘She is not dead’. What is denied is the 
inception of action, rather than the state or condition resulting from an incepted action.

provide the negation of auxiliary forms which have sprung from prepositional phrases; (b) The Prospective 
Conditional er4an- (§378); (c) The Past Temporal ntere- (§387); (d) The Conjunctive (§230).

Lesson =ij   13  The Conjunctions
Generally we can say that the article ovoh is used to join sentences and verbs, but the article nem is used to join adjectives and nouns.
Examples:
ovoh    And       (Conjuncting verbs)
`N0o4 a4goc ovoh a42wpi.
He   said  and  it was.
`N0o4 a4honhen ovoh avcwnt .
He ordered and it was created.
iPi`cbwov`i a4w2 ovoh a4`cqai `mpiw2.
The pupil read and  wrote the lesson.
Conjuncting sentences
ovoh matovbon ebolha 0wleb niben
and purify us from all uncleanliness.
nem And (Conjuncting nouns)
Anok pe 5anactacic nem piwnq
I am the resurrection and life.
`Cmov ero4 pir3 nem piioh
Praise Him O Sun and Moon.
Iwakim nem Anna
Yoakim and Anna
Exercise 13:
Read the following using one word from each column + ovoh to make practical sentences:
Rwic  ovoh `2l3l  `w pacon
Watch   And     Pray      O  my brother

Lesson 14 =id    Vocabulary
Last time we talked about the Conjunctions and said that the article ovoh is used to join sentences and verbs, but the article nem is used to join adjectives and nouns. Let's look at some passages used in our church
and notice the use of these conjuctions and also learn some new vocabulary:
From the First Hos (Canticle):
Tote a4hwc `nge Mwic3c nem nen23ri `mpiIcra3l
Then  he praised    Moses   and the sons of Israel
etaihwdi `nte `Psoic ovoh a4goc e0rovgoc
with this song  of the Lord  and (he)said [to say]*:
ge marenhwc `ePsoic ge qen ovwov jar a4siwov.
let us praise the Lord: for with glory he took glory.
* He (Moses) sang and said the song to lead the children of Israel [to say].
The Introduction to the Gospel said by the priest:
Pensoic-penu- ovoh pennov5 ovoh penovro t3ren
Our Lord and our God and our savior and our King all
I3covc Pixrictoc-I=3=c  P=x=c  - `p23ri `m`Fnov5-`mF5- etonq
Jesus Christ the son of God the Living
piwov na4 2a `eneh
the Glory to Him for ever.

Lesson 5 =e  The Rule of the GINKIM {`   }
In addition to the Coptic letters, the Coptic Language also make use of a dot-like phonatic symbol.  The GINKIM was not part of the original language, but was added to help readers pronounce the words.  There are
various forms
for the GINKIM (`    ~    =    ) and though some argue that the shape affects the opening of the mouth, it's generally accepted that they're all pronounced alike.
The Rule:
I. When it comes over a vowel letter, it splits the word, because the letter must be pronounced by itself.
A. First, we need to know the Coptic vowel letters:
The way I learned them is to first write the English vowel letters and then match their Coptic counterparts:
(English)    A    E       I    O       U
(Coptic)    a    e    3    i    o    v    w
Note: Y is considered a vowel because when it follows an O, it is pronounced an O; some authers consider OY rather than just Y as a vowel
B. Examples:
 
A`aron
is pron. A_a_roon      means   Aaron
Mari`a
Mari_a                Mary
 `Ebol
E_VOL                 Of 
Pek`3pocPEK_EE_POC            Your Garden
 
II. When GINKIM comes over a consonant letter, an e sound proceeds the  letter.
A. For Example:
`k = ek         `m = em         `n = en         `d = ed
B. Real Examples:
 
` K`cmarwovtis pron.   EK-ES-MARO-OOT   means You are Blessed 
` Nnovb
EN-NOUB                  The Gold 
` MMariam
EM-MARIAM               Of Mary 
III. Try reading these words:

Revelation (Apocalypse)
We can learn from the previous simple discription of the Bible that there are 3 types of articles used in the Coptic Language:
pi     `p    `f       for masculine singular
5     `t    `0        feminine singular
ni    nen             plural
There is no major difference between the use of any of the above articles other than that `fand `0can only be used if the word begins with one of the following letters:
    b    i    l    m    n    ov    r
Examples:
`fbwk The Servant
`0baki The City
`ﬁwt The Father
`0mav The Mother 
`fran The Name
`0negi The Womb 
i.e. you can usepirwmiinstead of`frwmi(The Man)
piran
`fran
(The Name)
+ The exceptions are that (The Father) is always `ﬁwtbecause piiwtmeans barley and also`piwt is an excpetion to differentiate between barley and father. There are some other rare exceptions and are all for
differentiation between words.
 
`|Povro(The King) is never written as `fovro
because when the word starts with ov we look to the letter next to them if it is a vowel we go on using `f if not we use`p hence,piovwini can be written as`fovwini
Exercise:
See if you can fill in the missing article appropriately.  Keep in
mind ease of pronunciation and the rule of `Q and `8.
